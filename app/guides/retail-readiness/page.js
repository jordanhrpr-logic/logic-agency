The critical calculation is safety stock: the buffer inventory you must maintain to avoid stockouts between reorders. A common formula is safety stock = (maximum daily sales \u00d7 maximum lead time) minus (average daily sales \u00d7 average lead time). Under-forecasting leads to stockouts and lost shelf space.

A product with 70% gross margin in DTC may have 25-40% gross margin through retail. Brands that don\u2019t model retail economics before committing to a retailer often discover their margin doesn\u2019t support the channel after they\u2019ve already invested in packaging, inventory, and onboarding."

Most of these are preventable with proper planning before the first PO ships."

          <h2 id="wired">The Wired Guide: Retail Launch From Logic&apos;s Lens</h2>

          <p>Most retail launch guides are written by marketing people. They talk about buyer meetings, pitch decks, and brand story. That&apos;s important &mdash; but it&apos;s chapter one of a seven-chapter book, and the other six chapters are operational.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s what a retail launch actually looks like when you map the supply chain, packaging, and operations workstreams that run in parallel from the moment a retailer says yes to the day your product hits shelf. This is how we think about it at Logic.</p>

                  <h4>Operational Assessment</h4>
                  <p>Before you commit to a retailer timeline, you need an honest assessment of your readiness. What packaging exists today, what needs to change, what supply chain infrastructure is in place, and what has to be built. This is where most brands skip straight to &ldquo;let&apos;s get boxes made&rdquo; and pay for it later.</p>

                  <h4>Retailer Compliance &amp; Vendor Onboarding</h4>
                  <p>Every retailer has a vendor onboarding process. EDI setup, insurance requirements, routing guide review, compliance acknowledgment, and often a packaging review before your first PO ships. Start this immediately &mdash; it takes longer than you think and delays here push everything downstream.</p>

                  <h4>Packaging System Development</h4>
                  <p>Parallel to onboarding: design or adapt your packaging for retail. Primary packaging for shelf presence and compliance. Secondary packaging (case packs) engineered to retailer specs. Tertiary (pallet configurations) optimized for freight efficiency. Prototyping, sampling, supplier sourcing, and production booking all run simultaneously.</p>

                  <h4>Inventory Planning &amp; Forecasting</h4>
                  <p>How much product do you need for the initial pipeline fill? What&apos;s your weekly sell-through estimate? What safety stock covers the gap between reorder signal and delivery? How much cash does this tie up? These numbers drive your production orders and your cash flow model. Get them wrong and you either stockout (lose shelf space) or overstock (burn cash).</p>

                  <h4>Ship, Receive, Reorder</h4>
                  <p>First shipment to retailer DC within the delivery window. ASN transmitted, pallets configured to routing guide specs, delivery appointment scheduled. Then immediately shift focus to replenishment: monitoring sell-through data, triggering reorders, managing the production pipeline so your second order arrives before your first sells through.</p>

              </div>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>The critical insight from this timeline: <strong>at least four workstreams run in parallel during months 1-3.</strong> Compliance, packaging, inventory planning, and cost modeling all happen simultaneously. Brands that tackle them sequentially (&ldquo;let&apos;s finish packaging then figure out inventory&rdquo;) run out of time before the retailer&apos;s delivery window.</p>

          {/* SECTION 2: ECONOMICS */}
          <h2 id="economics">Retail Economics: The Math Nobody Shows You</h2>

          <p>The most common reason brands fail at retail isn&apos;t product quality or packaging compliance. It&apos;s economics. They sell into a channel without modeling whether the margin sustains the business once wholesale pricing, trade spend, and retail-specific costs are factored in.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s how the economics actually change from DTC to retail:</p>

          <div className="econ">
            <div className="econ-header">

              <div>$18.00-22.00 (wholesale)</div>
            </div>
            <div className="econ-row">

              <div>$8.00</div>
              <div>$9.50 (retail packaging costs more)</div>
            </div>
            <div className="econ-row">
              <div>Fulfillment / freight</div>
              <div>$5.00</div>
              <div>$2.50 (bulk shipping is cheaper)</div>
            </div>
            <div className="econ-row">
              <div>Trade spend (slotting, promos, fees)</div>
              <div>$0</div>
              <div className="r">$2.00-5.00</div>
            </div>
            <div className="econ-row">
              <div>Chargeback risk</div>
              <div>$0</div>
              <div className="r">$0.50-2.00 (amortized)</div>
            </div>
            <div className="econ-row">
              <div>Gross margin per unit</div>
              <div className="g">$27.00 (67%)</div>
              <div>$4.00-8.00 (20-40%)</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>That&apos;s a product with healthy DTC economics showing 20-40% gross margin through retail. Many brands discover their margins are even thinner once real trade spend and compliance costs are factored in.</p>

          <div className="callout warn">
            <p><strong>The cash flow trap:</strong> Retail doesn&apos;t just compress your margin &mdash; it delays your cash. DTC customers pay at checkout. Retailers pay on Net 30-90 terms. Meanwhile, you&apos;ve already invested in inventory (production + freight + warehousing) 3-5 months before the retailer even places the PO. A $200,000 initial retail order might require $80-120,000 in upfront inventory investment that you won&apos;t see revenue on for 5-8 months.</p>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Model this before you commit.</strong> Build a retail P&amp;L that includes wholesale price, COGS with retail-specific packaging, freight to DC, trade spend (ask the buyer what to expect), chargeback budget (2-5% of wholesale initially), and the cash cycle timeline. If the math works, go. If it doesn&apos;t, either renegotiate terms or stay DTC until your unit economics improve.</p>

          {/* SECTION 3: PACKAGING */}
          <h2 id="packaging">Packaging: From DTC Box to Retail System</h2>

          <p>We wrote an <a href="/guides/retail-ready-packaging" style={{ color: 'var(--o)', fontWeight: 600 }}>entire guide on getting packaging retail-ready</a> &mdash; case packs, pallet specs, barcodes, compliance, and timeline. If you haven&apos;t read it, start there for the specifics.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s the strategic view: your DTC packaging and your retail packaging serve fundamentally different purposes and operate in fundamentally different supply chains.</p>

          <p><strong>DTC packaging delivers an experience.</strong> It ships one unit from warehouse to doorstep. The consumer opens it at home. You control every touchpoint. The packaging can be precious, detailed, and fragile &mdash; because it only survives one handling cycle.</p>

          <p><strong>Retail packaging delivers a system.</strong> It ships in bulk from factory to DC to store. It gets palletized, loaded, unloaded, stacked, broken down, re-stacked, and put on a shelf by someone who handles 500 products a day. It needs to be structurally durable, efficiently packable, compliant with a dozen specifications, and visually competitive from 6 feet away on a shelf next to ten competitors.</p>

          <p>The brands that succeed at retail don&apos;t try to adapt their DTC packaging. They build a packaging system designed for the retail supply chain from the start &mdash; or they engage a partner who does this every day and can make the transition in weeks instead of months.</p>

          <div className="callout win">
            <p><strong>The opportunity most brands miss:</strong> Retail packaging done right is actually cheaper per unit than DTC packaging. Bulk production economics, simpler structures (no custom inserts or tissue paper), and pallet-efficient sizing reduce your packaging COGS at scale. The investment is in the engineering upfront &mdash; the per-unit cost goes down.</p>
          </div>

          {/* SECTION 4: SUPPLY CHAIN */}
          <h2 id="supply-chain">Supply Chain Infrastructure You Need Before Day One</h2>

          <p>Retail doesn&apos;t tolerate the scrappy supply chain that works for DTC. Missing a delivery window by two days can trigger chargebacks. Running out of stock means the retailer gives your shelf space to someone else. Sending the wrong pallet configuration means your shipment gets rejected at the DC door.</p>

          <p>Here&apos;s the infrastructure you need in place before your first PO ships:</p>

          <h3>EDI and ASN Capability</h3>
          <p>Electronic Data Interchange is how retailers send purchase orders and how you confirm shipments. Advance Ship Notices tell the DC exactly what&apos;s arriving and when. Most major retailers require both. You&apos;ll either integrate through a third-party EDI provider (SPS Commerce, TrueCommerce) or your 3PL may offer EDI as a service. Budget $200-500/month for a basic EDI setup.</p>

          <h3>3PL or Warehouse That Understands Retail</h3>
          <p>Not every 3PL does retail fulfillment. Retail requires pallet building to exact specifications, routing guide compliance, delivery appointment scheduling, and ASN generation. Your DTC fulfillment partner may not offer these capabilities. Vet your 3PL against the specific retailer&apos;s routing guide before committing &mdash; switching 3PLs mid-launch is catastrophic.</p>

          <h3>Freight and Logistics Partners</h3>
          <p>Retail shipments go to distribution centers on full or partial pallets via LTL or FTL carriers. This is different from parcel shipping for DTC. You need a freight broker or carrier relationship, and you need to understand the retailer&apos;s preferred carriers and delivery appointment process. Late deliveries are penalized. Early deliveries are often rejected.</p>

          <h3>Quality Control Process</h3>
          <p>One defective batch that reaches a retailer&apos;s DC triggers chargebacks, returns, and potentially a vendor review that can cost you the account. You need inspection at the point of manufacture (especially for international sourcing), receiving inspection at your warehouse, and a documented process for catching and quarantining quality issues before they ship. This isn&apos;t optional &mdash; it&apos;s insurance.</p>

          {/* SECTION 5: FORECASTING */}
          <h2 id="forecasting">Inventory Forecasting for Retail</h2>

          <p>Forecasting for DTC is relatively forgiving &mdash; you control demand through marketing spend, and stockouts mean missed sales but rarely permanent consequences. Forecasting for retail is unforgiving. Run out of stock and the retailer may reduce your facings, pull your product from planogram, or discontinue you entirely. Overstock and you&apos;re sitting on cash that could have been deployed elsewhere, potentially taking markdowns that destroy your margin.</p>

          <h3>The Three Numbers You Need</h3>

          <div className="fc-box">
            <h4>1. Pipeline Fill (Initial Order)</h4>
            <p>The first order stocks the retailer&apos;s DC and fills shelves across all locations carrying your product. This is typically the largest single order you&apos;ll receive and it needs to cover: units per store &times; number of stores, plus DC safety stock. Ask the buyer for their planned distribution (how many stores/doors) and expected units per store.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 500 stores &times; 6 units per store = 3,000 units on shelf + 20% DC buffer = 3,600 total pipeline fill.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="fc-box">
            <h4>2. Weekly Sell-Through Velocity</h4>
            <p>How many units sell per store per week. You won&apos;t know this precisely until you&apos;re on shelf, but you can estimate from category data, the buyer&apos;s expectations, and comparable products. This number drives everything &mdash; reorder quantities, production planning, and cash flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> 0.5 units/store/week &times; 500 stores = 250 units/week sell-through.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="fc-box">
            <h4>3. Safety Stock</h4>
            <p>The buffer inventory that covers the gap between when you need to reorder and when that reorder arrives. This accounts for your production lead time, freight time, and variability in both demand and supply.</p>
            <div className="fc-formula">Safety Stock = (Max Weekly Sales &times; Max Lead Time in Weeks)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (Avg Weekly Sales &times; Avg Lead Time in Weeks)</div>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> (350 max &times; 14 weeks max) - (250 avg &times; 10 weeks avg) = 4,900 - 2,500 = 2,400 units safety stock.</p>
            <p>This means you should always have approximately 2,400 units in inventory or in transit to avoid stockouts under worst-case conditions.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="callout">
            <p><strong>The reorder trigger:</strong> Place your next production order when on-hand inventory hits safety stock + one lead time&apos;s worth of sales. If your safety stock is 2,400 units and you sell 250/week with a 10-week lead time, reorder when inventory hits 2,400 + 2,500 = 4,900 units. If you wait until you&apos;re at safety stock, you&apos;ve already started the clock on a potential stockout.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>The Cash Model Behind the Forecast</h3>

          <p>Inventory is cash sitting on a shelf. Before you commit to a retail program, model how much cash is locked in inventory at any given time:</p>

          <p><strong>Steady-state inventory investment</strong> = (Safety stock + Average cycle stock) &times; COGS per unit. Using the example above: (2,400 + 1,250) &times; $9.50 = <strong>$34,675 in inventory at all times.</strong> That&apos;s cash you need to fund continuously, separate from the pipeline fill investment.</p>

          <p>Add to that the timeline gap: you&apos;re spending on production today for revenue that arrives 3-5 months from now via Net 30-60 retailer payment. Brands that don&apos;t model this working capital requirement run into cash flow crises that feel sudden but were entirely predictable.</p>

          {/* SECTION 6: FAILURES */}
          <h2 id="failures">The Five Ways Brands Fail at Retail</h2>

          <p>After working with brands across beauty, CPG, and tech wearables entering and scaling in retail, these are the failure patterns we see repeatedly. Every one of them is operational, not product-related.</p>

          <div className="fail-grid">
            <div className="fail">
              <h4>1. Stockout Spiral</h4>
              <p>Underforecast initial demand or miss a reorder trigger. Product goes out of stock. Retailer reduces facings or shelf allocation. Lower allocation means less velocity. Less velocity means the product looks like a poor performer. Discontinuation follows. The spiral starts with one missed reorder.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fail">
              <h4>2. Chargeback Bleed</h4>
              <p>Packaging doesn&apos;t meet compliance specs. Pallets are configured wrong. ASNs are inaccurate. Deliveries arrive outside the window. Each violation triggers a chargeback: $200-10,000+. Brands absorb these &ldquo;one-time&rdquo; charges that happen every shipment until margin is gone. Usually traced to not reading the routing guide carefully enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fail">
              <h4>3. Cash Flow Crunch</h4>
              <p>Brand invests heavily in inventory for pipeline fill and first few reorders. Revenue from the retailer arrives on Net 60 terms. Meanwhile production costs for the next reorder are due. Working capital runs out before the retail channel becomes self-sustaining. The brand either takes on expensive debt or can&apos;t reorder.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fail">
              <h4>4. Margin Surprise</h4>
              <p>Brand models retail economics based on wholesale price minus COGS. Doesn&apos;t account for trade spend, slotting fees, promotional allowances, retail-specific packaging costs, EDI fees, chargeback reserves, or freight to DC. Actual margin is 15 points lower than projected. Discovered after the program is live.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="fail-grid">
            <div className="fail">
              <h4>5. Operational Overwhelm</h4>
              <p>Founder or small ops team tries to manage retail compliance, packaging production, inventory forecasting, 3PL coordination, and EDI alongside everything else. Balls get dropped. Quality slips. Reorders are late. The retail program becomes a drain on the entire company instead of a growth channel. Usually the trigger for seeking operational help &mdash; but often after preventable damage is done.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="fail" style={{ borderTopColor: '#16a34a' }}>
              <h4 style={{ color: '#16a34a' }}>The Common Thread</h4>
              <p>Every one of these failures is preventable with proper planning before the first PO ships. The brands that succeed at retail invest in operational infrastructure &mdash; packaging systems, supply chain partners, forecasting models, compliance processes &mdash; before they need them, not after something breaks.</p>
