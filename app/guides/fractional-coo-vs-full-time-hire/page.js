          <h2>The Real Cost of a Full-Time Operations Hire</h2>
          <p>Most founders start with salary. That is the wrong first question. The better question is: what operating function are we trying to build, and how many capabilities does that require?</p>
          <p>A senior operations hire for a scaling CPG brand can cost $180,000&ndash;$250,000 in base salary. Add benefits, payroll taxes, bonus, equity, recruiting fees, onboarding, software, and management time, and the all-in cost can reach $220,000&ndash;$350,000. That is for one person.</p>
          <p>But one person rarely covers the full scope. A brand moving from DTC into retail may need supply chain leadership, vendor sourcing, packaging engineering, 3PL coordination, inventory planning, retail compliance, freight optimization, and chargeback management. That is not one job. That is a function.</p>

          <h2>Hidden Costs Most Brands Miss</h2>
          <div className="cd-grid">
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">1</div><h3>Recruiting drag (90&ndash;180 days)</h3><p>During the search, vendors keep missing dates, inventory keeps aging, and retail requirements keep stacking up. The cost is not only the recruiting fee&mdash;it is operational drift while the seat is empty.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">2</div><h3>Ramp time (90&ndash;180 days)</h3><p>Even a great hire needs 90 days before they are truly useful and 180 days before they are fully effective. They are learning vendors, freight patterns, 3PL performance, and SKU economics from scratch.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">3</div><h3>Wrong-level hire risk</h3><p>Too senior: the person wants strategy but the business needs execution. Too junior: can manage tasks but cannot build the system. Both mistakes are expensive.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">4</div><h3>Founder time cost</h3><p>If a founder spends 10 hours a week managing operational issues, that is 520 hours a year not spent on product, growth, retail relationships, or team leadership. Operations cannot be treated as background work.</p></div>
          </div>
          <h2>When Full-Time Makes Sense vs. When to Go Fractional</h2>
          <div className="save-grid">
            <div className="save-item"><div className="save-pct">Hire Full-Time</div><h4>Stable, permanent, clearly defined</h4><p>Operations complexity is permanent. The brand has enough recurring work for one senior leader every day. The role is clearly defined and the budget can absorb the cost without starving growth.</p></div>
            <div className="save-item"><div className="save-pct">Go Fractional</div><h4>Cross-functional, changing needs</h4><p>The founder still owns supplier escalation. The brand is preparing for retail but has not built the operating system. Problems are spread across sourcing, packaging, freight, inventory, and retail compliance simultaneously.</p></div>
          </div>
          <p>A simple test: write down the 10 operating problems you need solved in the next 90 days and label each. If most fall into one or two categories, a full-time hire may be right. If they spread across six or seven, you probably need operating coverage&mdash;not a single hire.</p>
          <div className="callout"><p><strong>The hybrid path:</strong> Use fractional support to build the operating system first, define the role, stabilize vendors, document workflows. Then hire into a cleaner role. The eventual hire starts with a system instead of cleanup&mdash;and that is a better use of senior talent.</p></div>
