          <p className="b-lede">Switching 3PLs without losing a retail account requires a parallel transition: qualify the new warehouse, freeze the retail compliance rules, move inventory in phases, test order flows before cutover, and keep the old 3PL running until the new one proves it can ship cleanly. The mistake is treating a 3PL switch like a vendor change. It is an operating-system migration.</p>

            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Switch only when the current 3PL problem is structural, not a fixable service issue.</li>
              <li>Run the new 3PL in parallel before cutting over retail orders.</li>
              <li>Retail accounts need clean ship windows, ASN accuracy, and routing guide compliance during the transition.</li>
              <li>The real cost of switching includes overlap fees, inventory transfer, integration rebuild, and operational distraction.</li>
              <li>Most 3PL switches fail because brands move inventory before proving the order flow.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="when-to-switch">When Should a CPG Brand Switch 3PLs?</h2>

          <p>A CPG brand should switch 3PLs when the failures are repeatable, measurable, and tied to the warehouse&apos;s operating model. One bad week is not enough. A repeated pattern is.</p>

          <p>The most common structural red flags:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Inventory accuracy below 98%</li>
            <li>Late retail shipments that repeat across multiple POs</li>
            <li>ASN errors the 3PL cannot explain</li>
            <li>Poor lot or batch tracking</li>
            <li>No EDI capability for retail accounts</li>
            <li>No visibility into SLA performance</li>
            <li>High damage rates with no corrective process</li>
            <li>Slow receiving that creates sellable-inventory gaps</li>
            <li>No account owner who can solve problems</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The question is not &ldquo;are they annoying?&rdquo; Every 3PL is annoying sometimes. The question is: &ldquo;Can they support the channel mix we are building?&rdquo; If the answer is no, remediation may delay the problem. It will not solve it.</p>

          <h2 id="remediate">When Should You Remediate Instead of Switch?</h2>

          <p>Switching is expensive. It should not be the default response to friction.</p>

          <p>Remediate first when:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The issue has a clear root cause</li>
            <li>The 3PL agrees on the fix</li>
            <li>The problem is isolated to one workflow</li>
            <li>Service-level reporting exists</li>
            <li>The 3PL has proven capability in your channel</li>
            <li>The relationship is strained but not opaque</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For example, if pick accuracy dropped because of a new SKU launch and the 3PL can correct slotting, barcode, and training issues within 30 days, switching may be overkill. If the 3PL cannot tell you why inventory is wrong, that is different. Visibility is the line. If you cannot see the problem, you cannot manage the fix.</p>

          <h2 id="real-cost">The Real Cost of a 3PL Switch</h2>

          <p>Most brands budget for transfer freight and new setup fees. That is only part of the cost.</p>

          <p>The real cost stack includes:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Cost Category</th>
                <th>Typical Range</th>
                <th>What It Covers</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Inventory transfer freight</td>
                <td>$3,000&ndash;$20,000</td>
                <td>Moving physical inventory between warehouses</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Overlap fees</td>
                <td>$5,000&ndash;$25,000</td>
                <td>Running two 3PLs during transition</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>System integration rebuild</td>
                <td>$2,000&ndash;$15,000</td>
                <td>Shopify, ERP, EDI, order routing, reporting</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Receiving and relabeling</td>
                <td>$1,000&ndash;$10,000</td>
                <td>New labels, pallet rebuilds, count reconciliation</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Internal project time</td>
                <td>40&ndash;120 hours</td>
                <td>Ops, finance, customer service, retail account support</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>A clean 3PL switch usually requires 60&ndash;90 days. A rushed switch creates the same failures in a new building. Different logo. Same chaos.</p>

          <p>There is also a cash-timing issue most brands miss. The old 3PL may require open invoices to be cleared before releasing inventory. The new 3PL may require setup fees before receiving. Freight may need to be paid before the inventory is sellable again. That means a switch can create a short-term cash squeeze even when it is the right long-term move. Plan for it.</p>

          <h2 id="parallel-run">The Parallel-Run Transition Plan</h2>

          <p>The safest 3PL switch is not a switch. It is an overlap. Run both operations long enough to prove the new 3PL can receive, store, pick, pack, ship, report, and support retail compliance before you move all volume.</p>

          <h3>Phase 1: Qualification and Data Freeze</h3>

          <p>Before inventory moves, freeze the operating data:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>SKU master</li>
            <li>UPC and GTIN data</li>
            <li>Case pack configuration</li>
            <li>Lot or batch tracking rules</li>
            <li>Retail routing guide requirements</li>
            <li>Label templates</li>
            <li>EDI transaction set requirements</li>
            <li>Inventory count by location</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the data is messy when it leaves the old 3PL, it will be messier when it reaches the new one. The data transfer matters as much as the inventory transfer.</p>

          <h3>Phase 2: Test Orders</h3>

          <p>Before retail orders move, run test orders through the new warehouse:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>One DTC order</li>
            <li>One wholesale order</li>
            <li>One retail-compliant order</li>
            <li>One return</li>
            <li>One inventory adjustment</li>
            <li>One ASN test if retail EDI is involved</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Do not treat test orders as a technical formality. They are the only safe way to find broken workflows before a real buyer sees them.</p>

          <h3>Phase 3: Split Volume</h3>

          <p>Move low-risk volume first. That usually means DTC orders or non-time-sensitive wholesale orders. Keep the highest-stakes retail account at the old 3PL until the new 3PL proves the process.</p>

          <p>The sequence matters:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Transfer slow-moving inventory first</li>
            <li>Test receiving accuracy</li>
            <li>Run low-risk order flow</li>
            <li>Reconcile inventory</li>
            <li>Move priority SKUs</li>
            <li>Move retail accounts last</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Retail should not be the test case.</p>

          <h3>Phase 4: Retail Cutover</h3>

          <p>Retail cutover should happen only after:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Inventory accuracy is reconciled</li>
            <li>EDI tests pass</li>
            <li>Label templates pass scan tests</li>
            <li>Routing guide requirements are loaded</li>
            <li>Carrier pickup windows are confirmed</li>
            <li>First shipment documentation is reviewed</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The first retail PO out of the new 3PL should be treated like a launch. Because operationally, it is one.</p>

          <h2 id="90-day-timeline">A 90-Day 3PL Switch Timeline</h2>

          <p>Most brands need a 90-day switch plan if retail accounts are involved.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 1&ndash;15: Confirm the reason for switching.</strong> Document the current failure pattern. Inventory accuracy, late shipments, receiving delays, chargebacks, slow response time, bad reporting. If you cannot name the reason, you cannot evaluate whether the next 3PL fixes it.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 16&ndash;30: Run the 3PL search.</strong> Send the same operating brief to every candidate: SKU count, order volume, channel mix, retailer requirements, EDI needs, returns flow, value-added services, and seasonal peaks. Do not let each 3PL define the scope differently.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 31&ndash;45: Validate capability.</strong> Ask for retail account examples, sample SLA reporting, receiving timelines, WMS screenshots, label workflow, EDI transaction support, and escalation process. This is where weak candidates expose themselves.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 46&ndash;60: Build the cutover plan.</strong> Decide what moves first, what stays temporarily, what gets tested, and who owns every integration. The plan should include inventory reconciliation, order-routing rules, customer service scripts, and buyer communication if a retail PO is near the transition window.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 61&ndash;75: Test receiving and order flow.</strong> Send a controlled inventory batch. Run test orders. Compare system inventory to physical counts. Confirm reports match reality.</p>

          <p><strong>Days 76&ndash;90: Move priority volume.</strong> Shift live volume only after the test flow works. Retail orders move last unless the old 3PL is actively failing that account.</p>

          <h2 id="buyer-communication">What to Tell Retail Buyers During a 3PL Switch</h2>

          <p>Most brands do not need to announce every operational change to a buyer. But if a shipment window, compliance workflow, or replenishment order is affected, silence creates risk.</p>

          <p>The update should be short:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>What is changing</li>
            <li>What is not changing</li>
            <li>Who owns the transition</li>
            <li>Whether PO timing is affected</li>
            <li>What controls are in place to protect service</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Do not over-explain. Buyers care about whether the product arrives cleanly. They do not need the internal warehouse drama. They need confidence that their account is protected.</p>

          <h2 id="scorecard">The 3PL Switch Scorecard</h2>

          <p>Before final cutover, score the new 3PL on five items:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Inventory accuracy:</strong> Does system inventory match physical inventory after receiving?</li>
            <li><strong>Order accuracy:</strong> Did test orders ship correctly, on time, with correct labels?</li>
            <li><strong>Retail compliance:</strong> Can they support routing guides, appointments, ASN timing, and documentation?</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Can you see exceptions before they become customer issues?</li>
            <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> Does one accountable person own the relationship?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>If any score is weak, slow the transition. The goal is not to move fast. The goal is to move once.</p>

          <h2 id="three-mistakes">The Three Mistakes Brands Make During a 3PL Switch</h2>

          <h3>Mistake 1: Moving Inventory Before Moving Data</h3>

          <p>Inventory without accurate SKU data is not sellable inventory. It is physical product waiting for correction. Get item master data clean first.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 2: Assuming the New 3PL Knows Retail</h3>

          <p>&ldquo;We do retail&rdquo; can mean many things. It can mean they ship wholesale cartons. It can mean they support routing guides, appointment scheduling, GS1 labels, ASN timing, and chargeback dispute documentation. Those are different capabilities. Ask for proof.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 3: Cutting Over During Peak Season</h3>

          <p>If the current 3PL is failing during peak season, switching may feel urgent. It is also the most dangerous time to move. If possible, stabilize first. Then switch. If you cannot wait, narrow the scope: move one channel, one SKU family, or one geography first.</p>

          <h2 id="protect-retail">How to Protect Retail Commitments During the Switch</h2>

          <p>Retail commitments should be isolated from the transition plan. Start by listing every open retail PO, expected replenishment order, and buyer commitment inside the next 90 days. Then assign each to one of three categories:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Do not touch:</strong> Orders already in motion or tied to a strict delivery window.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Orders that can ship from either 3PL but need extra documentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Move carefully:</strong> Future orders with enough lead time to test through the new warehouse.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This is where brands get hurt. They treat all inventory as one pool. Retail inventory is different because a missed shipment can damage the account, not just the order. Protect the account first. Then optimize the warehouse.</p>

          <h2 id="faq" className="b-faq-h">FAQ</h2>

          <h3>How long does it take to switch 3PLs?</h3>
          <p>Most CPG brands need 60&ndash;90 days for a controlled 3PL switch. Complex retail accounts, EDI integrations, or lot-controlled inventory can push the timeline longer.</p>

          <h3>Should a brand run two 3PLs during the transition?</h3>
          <p>Yes. A parallel run protects retail commitments while the new 3PL proves receiving, inventory accuracy, order flow, and compliance.</p>

          <h3>What should move first in a 3PL transition?</h3>
          <p>Move low-risk volume first: slow-moving SKUs, DTC orders, or non-time-sensitive wholesale. Move retail accounts after the new 3PL proves the process.</p>

          <h3>What is the biggest risk in switching 3PLs?</h3>
          <p>The biggest risk is not transfer freight. It is bad data: inaccurate inventory counts, incorrect SKU master data, broken labels, or untested EDI workflows.</p>

          <h3>When should a brand not switch 3PLs?</h3>
          <p>Do not switch when the problem is isolated and fixable, when you are inside a critical retail launch window, or when the new 3PL has not proven channel fit.</p>
