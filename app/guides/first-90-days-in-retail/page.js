          <h2>Before We Start: The Feeling Nobody Prepares You For</h2>
          <p>You spent months &mdash; maybe years &mdash; trying to get a retail buyer to say yes. You pitched, you sampled, you followed up, you waited. And now they said yes.</p>
          <p>The first feeling is euphoria. You tell your team, your investors, your family. You post on LinkedIn. You&apos;re going to be in stores.</p>
          <p>The second feeling, usually about 48 hours later, is terror. Because now you have to actually deliver. And the distance between &ldquo;a buyer said yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;product on shelf&rdquo; is a chasm filled with packaging specs, compliance documents, production timelines, freight logistics, and financial commitments that most DTC brands have never navigated.</p>
          <p>This guide is the map through that chasm.</p>

          {/* WEEKS 1-3 */}
          <h2>Weeks 1-3: The Scramble</h2>

              <span className="week-title">The Reality Check</span>
            </div>
            <p>The buyer sends over the vendor onboarding packet. It&apos;s 40-80 pages. It contains insurance requirements, EDI specifications, routing guide details, labeling standards, packaging specs, and compliance acknowledgments you&apos;ve never seen before. Your stomach drops.</p>
            <p>You also discover that your current packaging &mdash; the beautiful DTC box you&apos;re so proud of &mdash; doesn&apos;t work for retail. It&apos;s the wrong size for standard case packs. The barcode is in the wrong place. There&apos;s no case-level UPC. The structural integrity won&apos;t survive palletization and distribution center handling. The shelf-facing orientation doesn&apos;t make sense for a retail planogram.</p>
            <p><strong>This is normal.</strong> Every brand goes through this. The ones that survive the next 90 days are the ones that start moving immediately instead of spending two weeks processing the shock.</p>

              <span className="week-badge crisis">Week 2</span>
              <span className="week-title">The Packaging Reckoning</span>
            </div>
            <p>You&apos;ve read the routing guide. You&apos;ve audited your packaging. And now you&apos;re confronting a hard truth: your DTC packaging and your retail packaging are fundamentally different things.</p>
            <p>DTC packaging delivers an experience. It ships one unit from warehouse to doorstep. You control every touchpoint. Retail packaging delivers a system. It ships in bulk from factory to distribution center to store. It gets palletized, loaded, unloaded, stacked, broken down, re-stacked, and placed on a shelf by someone who handles 500 products a day. It needs to be structurally durable, efficiently packable, and compliant with specifications that didn&apos;t exist in your DTC world.</p>
            <p>You have two choices: try to adapt your existing packaging (faster but compromised) or design a retail-specific packaging system from scratch (better long-term but takes more time). Most brands with a tight deadline end up somewhere in between &mdash; keeping the primary packaging design but reengineering the structure, adding case packs, and building pallet configurations.</p>
            <div className="callout">
              <p><strong>The decision that saves you months later:</strong> Whatever you do now, document everything. Dielines, specs, BOMs, case pack configurations, pallet patterns. If your packaging knowledge lives in email threads and supplier conversations, you don&apos;t have a system &mdash; you have a dependency. Build the documentation now when you&apos;re already doing the work.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <span className="week-title">The Money Conversation</span>
            </div>
            <p>By week three you have enough information to build a real financial model. And for most DTC brands, this is the most uncomfortable week of the entire 90 days.</p>

            </div>

            <p>This is where some brands pump the brakes. And honestly? That&apos;s sometimes the right call. If the margin doesn&apos;t work at wholesale pricing, or if the cash outlay would put the business at risk, it&apos;s better to renegotiate terms, start with a smaller distribution, or delay the launch until the economics are solid. A bad first retail experience is worse than waiting six more months.</p>
            <p>But if the math works &mdash; even if it&apos;s tight &mdash; week three is when you commit. Everything after this point is execution.</p>

          {/* WEEKS 4-6 */}
          <h2>Weeks 4-6: The Build</h2>

          <div className="week">
            <div className="week-header">
              <span className="week-badge">Week 4</span>
              <span className="week-title">Packaging Goes Into Production</span>
            </div>
            <p>You&apos;ve finalized your retail packaging specs. Samples have been approved. The production order is placed. For domestic packaging, you&apos;re looking at 2-4 weeks. For international, 6-8 weeks &mdash; which means if you&apos;re sourcing overseas, you probably needed to start this in week one. (This is the most common timeline mistake brands make.)</p>
            <p>Simultaneously, your vendor onboarding should be nearly complete. EDI is being tested. Insurance certificates are filed. Your 3PL has received and reviewed the routing guide.</p>
            <p>At this point, you should be running four workstreams in parallel: packaging production, product manufacturing (if separate from packaging), vendor onboarding completion, and inventory planning. If any one of these is sequential instead of parallel, you&apos;re behind.</p>
            <div className="callout real">
              <p><strong>From the field:</strong> We had a skincare brand that was running all four workstreams sequentially &mdash; &ldquo;let&apos;s finish packaging, then figure out production, then do onboarding.&rdquo; By the time they engaged us, they had six weeks to deliver and hadn&apos;t started production. We got them on shelf, but it required air freighting product at 4x the ocean freight cost. The margin on the first order was almost zero. The system we built afterward ensured it never happened again &mdash; but that first order was painful.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="week">
            <div className="week-header">
              <span className="week-badge">Week 5</span>
              <span className="week-title">The Inventory Math</span>
            </div>
            <p>Your first order is in production. Now you need to answer the question that determines whether you&apos;re still on shelf in six months: <strong>when do you place your second order?</strong></p>
            <p>This isn&apos;t intuitive for DTC brands. In DTC, you reorder when inventory gets low. In retail, by the time inventory gets low, it&apos;s too late &mdash; your production lead time means the shelf will be empty for weeks before the reorder arrives. The retailer will notice. They may give your shelf space to someone else.</p>
            <p>You need to place your reorder before your first shipment even arrives at the retailer. That means committing cash to a second production run before you&apos;ve received a dollar from the first one.</p>
            <p>The math: estimate your weekly sell-through velocity (units per store per week &times; number of stores). Multiply by your total production and freight lead time in weeks. Add safety stock. That&apos;s how much inventory you need to have on hand or in production at all times. Set a reorder point that triggers the next production run with enough runway to avoid a gap.</p>
            <div className="callout warn">
              <p><strong>The stockout spiral is real.</strong> Brand runs out of stock in week 8. Retailer sees empty shelf. Retailer reduces facings (shelf space) at next planogram reset. Reduced facings mean lower velocity. Lower velocity makes the product look like a poor performer. Discontinuation follows. This entire spiral starts with one missed reorder. Plan it now &mdash; before your first shipment arrives.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="week">
            <div className="week-header">
              <span className="week-badge">Week 6</span>
              <span className="week-title">Quality Control and the Details That Kill You</span>
            </div>
            <p>Packaging production is finishing. Before anything ships, inspect it. Not a spot check &mdash; a proper AQL inspection of the full run.</p>
            <p>Check barcode scannability. Not visually &mdash; with an actual scanner. A barcode that doesn&apos;t scan at the DC causes your entire shipment to be rejected or hit with a chargeback. Check case pack counts. Every case must have exactly the specified unit count. Check case labels. Check pallet weight. Check case dimensions against the routing guide.</p>
            <p>These details feel tedious. They are also the difference between a smooth first delivery and a $5,000 chargeback that eats your margin on the entire order.</p>
            <p>If you&apos;re sourcing internationally, this inspection happens at the factory before the goods ship. If domestically, it happens at your warehouse. Either way, someone competent needs to physically verify that what was produced matches what was specified. Trusting the supplier to self-inspect on your first retail order is a gamble with odds you don&apos;t want to take.</p>
          </div>

            </div>
            <p>Product is produced. Packaging is done. QC is passed. Now you need to get it to the retailer&apos;s distribution center &mdash; on time, in the exact configuration they specified, with the correct documentation.</p>
            <p>If you&apos;re shipping domestically, this means palletizing to the routing guide&apos;s Ti &times; Hi configuration, stretch-wrapping and corner-boarding per spec, scheduling a delivery appointment at the DC (not just showing up &mdash; DCs have narrow receiving windows), transmitting an ASN (Advance Ship Notice) via EDI that exactly matches the physical shipment, and coordinating with your freight carrier on timing.</p>
            <p>If you&apos;re shipping internationally, add ocean freight booking (3-5 weeks), customs clearance, drayage from port to warehouse, deconsolidation, repalletizing to US retail specs, and then everything above.</p>
            <p>Every step has a potential failure point. Late delivery? Chargeback. Wrong pallet configuration? Chargeback. ASN doesn&apos;t match the shipment? Chargeback. Delivery outside the appointment window? You guessed it.</p>

              <p>&ldquo;I used to think logistics was just shipping. Now I understand it&apos;s a chain of fifty things that all need to go right in sequence, and one mistake at any point can cost thousands of dollars. I have a new respect for people who do this for a living.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Your shipment is en route to the DC. The delivery appointment is scheduled. The ASN has been transmitted. Everything is on track.</p>
            <p>And then something goes sideways. The carrier misses the appointment. Or the DC is backed up and reschedules. Or a quality issue surfaces during receiving. Or the pallet label format is wrong and the DC can&apos;t process the inbound.</p>
            <p>This is the week where brands learn that retail logistics isn&apos;t just about moving boxes &mdash; it&apos;s about managing exceptions. Something will go wrong on your first shipment. The question isn&apos;t whether; it&apos;s how fast you can identify it, communicate it, and resolve it before it becomes a chargeback or a delay that pushes you past your delivery window.</p>
            <p><strong>Document everything.</strong> Take photos of pallets before they ship. Save the BOL (Bill of Lading) with the carrier&apos;s signature. Keep records of every communication with the DC. If a chargeback comes &mdash; and on a first shipment, there&apos;s a decent chance one will &mdash; you&apos;ll need this documentation to dispute it.</p>

          <h2>Weeks 11-13: On Shelf</h2>

          <div className="week">
            <div className="week-header">
              <span className="week-badge go">Week 11</span>
              <span className="week-title">The First Scan</span>
            </div>
            <p>Your product has been received at the DC. It&apos;s been allocated to stores. It&apos;s on a truck heading to retail locations. And then &mdash; somewhere in the country &mdash; someone picks up your product, brings it to the register, and it scans.</p>
            <p>The first sale. After months of preparation, tens of thousands of dollars in investment, and more operational complexity than you&apos;ve ever managed, your product is selling in a retail store.</p>
            <p>Take a moment. Then immediately shift your attention to what happens next.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="week">
            <div className="week-header">
              <span className="week-badge go">Weeks 12-13</span>
              <span className="week-title">The Reorder Race</span>
            </div>
            <p>Your first sell-through data starts coming in. If you have access to the retailer&apos;s portal, you can see weekly sales by store. If not, you&apos;re estimating based on your initial order and the time since store delivery.</p>
            <p>This data is the most important information you&apos;ve received since the buyer said yes. It tells you whether your sell-through assumptions were accurate, which stores are performing and which aren&apos;t, and when you&apos;ll need to ship your next order to avoid a stockout.</p>
            <p>If your second production run is already in progress (as it should be if you followed the week 5 plan), you&apos;re in good shape. You&apos;re monitoring velocity, adjusting forecasts, and managing the pipeline. If you haven&apos;t started your second order yet, you&apos;re now in emergency mode &mdash; every day of delay increases your stockout risk.</p>
            <p><strong>The first 90 days don&apos;t end on day 90.</strong> They transition into a continuous cycle of monitoring, reordering, optimizing, and managing the relationship with the retailer. The operational infrastructure you built in the first 90 days &mdash; the documentation, the supplier relationships, the forecasting model, the compliance processes &mdash; is now the system that either sustains your retail presence or lets it erode.</p>
          </div>

          {/* SURPRISES */}
          <h2>The Seven Things Nobody Warned You About</h2>
          <p>Every brand we&apos;ve guided through their first retail launch encounters at least three of these. Knowing they&apos;re coming doesn&apos;t eliminate the pain, but it does eliminate the panic.</p>

          <div className="surp-grid">
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>1. Chargebacks are relentless</h4>
              <p>You will receive chargebacks on your first shipment. Maybe for labeling. Maybe for pallet configuration. Maybe for ASN accuracy. Budget 3-5% of your first order&apos;s wholesale value for chargebacks and work to drive it to zero on subsequent shipments. Fight every one that&apos;s disputable &mdash; but know that some are learning costs.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>2. The buyer goes quiet after saying yes</h4>
              <p>The buyer who was so responsive during the pitch process often becomes unreachable once the PO is issued. They have 200 other vendors and 50 other launches. You won&apos;t get hand-holding. You need to navigate onboarding, compliance, and delivery largely on your own &mdash; or with a partner who&apos;s done it before.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>3. Your 3PL might not be retail-ready</h4>
              <p>The fulfillment partner that handles your DTC orders flawlessly may have no idea how to build a retail-compliant pallet, generate an ASN, or schedule a DC delivery appointment. Discover this in week one, not week eight. Ask them directly: &ldquo;Have you shipped to this retailer&apos;s DC before?&rdquo;</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>4. EDI is harder than it sounds</h4>
              <p>Electronic Data Interchange sounds straightforward &mdash; digital purchase orders and shipping confirmations. In practice, every retailer has different specs, testing requirements, and error handling. Allow 2-4 weeks for setup and testing through a provider like SPS Commerce. Don&apos;t assume it&apos;ll &ldquo;just work.&rdquo;</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>5. The second order matters more than the first</h4>
              <p>Your first order fills the pipeline. Your second order proves you can sustain the business. If there&apos;s a gap between your first order selling through and your second order arriving, you&apos;ve lost shelf momentum. The retailer evaluates you on continuity, not just the first impression.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>6. Retail packaging costs more than you budgeted</h4>
              <p>Case pack boxes, pallet labels, retailer-specific labeling, structural upgrades for distribution handling, UPC registration &mdash; the costs that don&apos;t exist in DTC packaging. Budget 20-40% more than your current packaging cost per unit for the retail version.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="surp">
              <h4>7. You need help sooner than you think</h4>
              <p>Most brands try to manage their first retail launch internally. Most of those brands end up seeking help around week 3-4 when the scope of the operational challenge becomes clear. The brands that engage an experienced partner before the chaos starts have smoother launches, fewer chargebacks, and better margin on the first order.</p>

          </div>

          {/* CLOSING */}
          <h2>The 90-Day Lesson</h2>
          <p>Your first 90 days in retail will teach you more about your business than the previous two years of DTC combined. You&apos;ll learn how your supply chain actually performs under pressure. You&apos;ll learn where your packaging was engineered well and where it was designed for aesthetics rather than function. You&apos;ll learn the true cost of your product &mdash; not just COGS, but landed, packaged, freighted, compliant, and on-shelf cost.</p>
          <p>The brands that thrive in retail aren&apos;t the ones with the best product or the prettiest packaging. They&apos;re the ones that built the operational infrastructure to support the product once it&apos;s on shelf. Forecasting that prevents stockouts. Documentation that prevents chargebacks. Supplier relationships that prevent delays. Cash models that prevent surprises.</p>
          <p>That infrastructure can take months to build from scratch &mdash; or it can be in place from week one if you have the right partner.</p>
          <p>Either way, the 90-day clock starts the moment the buyer says yes. And it doesn&apos;t wait for you to be ready.</p>
