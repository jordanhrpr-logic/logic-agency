            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chargebacks are a pre-shipment problem. Every deduction can be traced to something that could have been caught before the carrier picked up the load.</li>
              <li>The highest-risk categories are routing guide violations, case pack errors, carton label failures, and ASN timing &mdash; four things you control completely.</li>
              <li>A pre-shipment audit takes 2&ndash;3 hours per PO. A chargeback that reaches dispute costs 8&ndash;12 hours to resolve and still often loses an estimated 30&ndash;40% of the time.</li>
              <li>The dispute vs. absorb decision should be systematic, not emotional. Amount, root cause, and documentation coverage determine whether a dispute is worth pursuing.</li>
              <li>Prevention is a repeatable operating system, not a one-time checklist. The brands with under 1% deduction rates run the same audit every shipment, without exception.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>The most expensive chargebacks are the ones you paid for twice &mdash; once for the violation, once to fix the process after.</p>

          <p>Most chargeback conversations happen after the deduction hits. By then, the shipment is at the DC, the receiving window is closed, and the leverage to fix anything is gone. The only productive conversation happens before the trailer leaves your 3PL. This guide is about that conversation.</p>

          <h2 id="pre-shipment-problem">Why Chargebacks Are a Pre-Shipment Problem</h2>

          <p>Most brands treat chargebacks as a finance problem. They see the deduction in the retailer portal, send it to accounting, debate whether to dispute, and move on. The cycle repeats next shipment.</p>

          <p>The brands with under 1% deduction rates treat chargebacks as an operations problem. They catch violations before they become violations. The shipment that never triggers a chargeback is the one that passed a real pre-shipment audit.</p>

          <p>A routing guide violation means you shipped with the wrong carrier, missed appointment scheduling rules, or used the wrong freight method. None of those things happen in the receiving dock. They happen when someone books the carrier without checking the routing guide. The fix is a routing guide review before the carrier is booked &mdash; not a dispute email three weeks later.</p>

          <p>A case pack error means the physical shipment does not match the purchase order or the retailer&apos;s item setup. It happens in the factory, at the time of packing, because the correct case count was never confirmed in writing before production. The fix is confirming case pack configuration before the factory runs &mdash; not a shortage credit conversation after receiving.</p>

          <h2 id="audit-checklist">The Pre-Shipment Audit Checklist</h2>

          <p>Run this audit before every PO ships. The categories mirror the most common chargeback reason codes. Check every item. Flag any that cannot be confirmed. Do not ship until the flags are resolved.</p>

          <h3>Category 1: Item Setup and PO Alignment</h3>

          <p>Item setup errors are the category that generates the most downstream issues. Everything else in the shipment is measured against what the retailer has on file for your items.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Confirm UPCs in the retailer&apos;s vendor portal match the physical products shipping in this PO.</li>
            <li>Confirm case pack count (units per case) on the PO matches the factory packing instructions, in writing, not from memory.</li>
            <li>Confirm inner pack configuration if the retailer requires inner packs &mdash; verify the inner count, not just the case count.</li>
            <li>Confirm product weights and dimensions on file at the retailer match the actual carton and pallet &mdash; discrepancies create receiving delays and shortage claims.</li>
            <li>Confirm country of origin, lot code, and expiration date requirements for this retailer and this category.</li>
            <li>Confirm that the item is active and authorized to ship to the specific destination DC on this PO.</li>
            <li>If this is a new item, confirm EDI item setup is complete and acknowledged before shipping.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Category 2: Routing Guide Compliance</h3>

          <p>The routing guide is a living document. It updates. Most chargebacks from routing violations come from brands using the guide from the last PO instead of downloading the current version.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Download the routing guide for this specific retailer this week, not from a saved file.</li>
            <li>Confirm the approved carrier list for this origin zip code and destination DC.</li>
            <li>Confirm the preferred freight method (prepaid vs. collect, LTL vs. FTL, direct vs. pool distribution) for this PO size and destination.</li>
            <li>Book the carrier before the ship window opens, not on the ship date.</li>
            <li>Confirm delivery appointment was scheduled and acknowledged by the DC &mdash; keep the confirmation number on file.</li>
            <li>Confirm must-arrive-by date and verify the confirmed delivery falls within the window, with buffer for transit variance.</li>
            <li>If the routing guide changed since your last PO, brief your 3PL on the change before this shipment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Category 3: Carton Labeling and Barcode Standards</h3>

          <p>Carton label failures are the most preventable category. The information is available. The standard is published. The fix is auditing before printing.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Pull the current carton labeling requirements from the retailer&apos;s vendor portal for this PO.</li>
            <li>Confirm GS1-128 label placement on the carton: corner placement, right justified, typically at the lowest left corner.</li>
            <li>Print a sample label and scan it against the retailer&apos;s barcode quality standard (ANSI/ISO grade C or better is standard; some retailers require B or better).</li>
            <li>Confirm the label includes all required data elements: SSCC, PO number, item number, UPC, quantity, ship-from address, ship-to DC code.</li>
            <li>Confirm your 3PL&apos;s label printer is calibrated and that print quality matches the approved proof before production-run printing.</li>
            <li>Take a photo of one carton label from the production run as a record &mdash; this becomes your documentation if a label dispute arises.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Category 4: Pallet Configuration and Load Standards</h3>

          <p>Pallet violations often generate chargeback batches &mdash; one non-compliant pallet type affects every pallet in the load.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Confirm pallet type requirements for this DC &mdash; GMA Grade A, heat-treated, no block pallets, etc.</li>
            <li>Confirm Ti&ndash;Hi (tier count &times; tier height) matches the retailer&apos;s standard for this category.</li>
            <li>Confirm maximum pallet height &mdash; typically 48&ndash;50 inches for in-store delivery, sometimes different for DC receiving.</li>
            <li>Confirm stretch wrap standard &mdash; number of wraps, coverage of top tier, overlap percentage.</li>
            <li>Confirm pallet label placement &mdash; some retailers require pallet labels on all four sides; others require specific placement only.</li>
            <li>Have your 3PL supervisor physically verify one pallet from the build before the load is sealed and the trailer departs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Category 5: ASN Accuracy and Timing</h3>

          <p>The ASN is where the most common first-year chargebacks originate. EDI accuracy, not EDI setup, is where brands get hit.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Confirm the ASN will be transmitted before the carrier pickup, not after &mdash; most retailers require the 856 sent at or before pickup scan.</li>
            <li>Confirm the ASN transmission window for this specific retailer.</li>
            <li>Verify the ASN reflects the actual physical shipment: SKUs, quantities, carton counts, pallet counts, carrier, pro/tracking number.</li>
            <li>If your 3PL manages ASN transmission, confirm they have a checklist and confirmation process.</li>
            <li>Confirm the ASN matches the PO quantities &mdash; partial shipments require ASN modification before transmission.</li>
            <li>If there is any variance between the physical shipment and the PO, contact the retailer buyer before shipping, not after receiving.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Category 6: Documentation Package</h3>

          <p>The documentation package is what wins disputes. Build it before the shipment, not after the deduction.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Confirm the bill of lading matches the ASN exactly &mdash; carrier, units, weight, number of pallets.</li>
            <li>Retain a signed copy of the BOL from the carrier at pickup. Digital confirmation alone is insufficient in most dispute processes.</li>
            <li>Take timestamped photos of the full pallet build, the carton labeling, the load condition before doors close, and the trailer seal.</li>
            <li>Save the ASN transmission timestamp and confirmation record.</li>
            <li>Save the delivery appointment confirmation with the DC appointment number and confirmed date.</li>
            <li>If any pre-shipment condition deviates from the routing guide or PO, document the issue and the decision made.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="dispute-framework">Dispute vs. Absorb: The Decision Framework</h2>

          <p>Not every chargeback should be disputed. A dispute requires 8&ndash;12 hours of documentation assembly, communication, and portal management. The resolution rate for disputes &mdash; even valid ones &mdash; often runs an estimated 50&ndash;70% at most retailers. The calculus matters.</p>

          <h3>When to Dispute</h3>

          <p>Dispute when all three conditions are true:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>The amount is material.</strong> Below $200&ndash;$300, the internal cost of pursuing the dispute often exceeds the recovery. Set a minimum.</li>
            <li><strong>The error is not yours.</strong> The retailer or carrier made the mistake &mdash; a mislabeled DC, a receiving error, a carrier who missed the appointment despite confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>You have documentation.</strong> ASN timestamp, carrier appointment confirmation, BOL, photos. Without specific evidence, most disputes are rejected on first submission.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>When to Absorb</h3>

          <p>Absorb when any of the following are true:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The amount is under your internal dispute threshold.</li>
            <li>Your team made the error &mdash; wrong carrier, late ASN, case pack mismatch, label failure.</li>
            <li>You do not have documentation to support the dispute.</li>
            <li>The buyer relationship is in an early stage and you need goodwill more than you need the recovery.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Routing guide and labeling chargebacks are almost always your responsibility. Retailers rarely make routing guide errors &mdash; their systems are automated. If the reason code is a routing guide violation or a labeling non-compliance, audit your own process before disputing.</p>

          <h3>How to Submit a Dispute When You Do Pursue It</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Log the chargeback in the retailer&apos;s vendor portal within the dispute window &mdash; typically 30&ndash;60 days from the deduction.</li>
            <li>Attach specific documentation: ASN timestamp, appointment confirmation, BOL with carrier signature, photos.</li>
            <li>Write a single-paragraph claim statement that ties the documentation to the specific reason code being disputed. Be direct.</li>
            <li>Follow up once at the midpoint of the portal&apos;s stated review window. Do not escalate to the buyer unless the portal process is exhausted.</li>
            <li>Record the outcome &mdash; won, lost, or partially recovered &mdash; and categorize by reason code. Over six months, the data will show you where you are actually competitive in disputes.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="operating-system">How to Build Chargeback Prevention Into the Operating System</h2>

          <p>A single pre-shipment audit run before a high-stakes launch is useful. Running the same audit before every shipment, without exception, is what actually drives deduction rates below 1%.</p>

          <p><strong>Assign ownership.</strong> One person owns the pre-shipment checklist completion for each PO. The key is that it is not a shared responsibility &mdash; it is a named one.</p>

          <p><strong>Tie checklist completion to ship authorization.</strong> The 3PL should not release a load without a completed pre-shipment audit. If the brand&apos;s ops coordinator has not signed off, the load does not leave.</p>

          <p><strong>Review chargebacks by reason code, not by dollar amount.</strong> Sort the last quarter&apos;s deductions by reason code. The code with the most occurrences is your process failure. Fix that process before optimizing for anything else.</p>

          <p><strong>Update the checklist when routing guides change.</strong> Pull the current guide at the start of every new PO cycle. If anything changed, flag it in the audit before shipment.</p>

          <p><strong>Brief 3PLs every quarter.</strong> A quarterly 30-minute touchpoint on compliance performance and process keeps them calibrated.</p>

          <h3>How Logic Agency Manages This for Client Brands</h3>

          <p>When we take on a brand&apos;s retail operations, the pre-shipment audit is built into every PO workflow. It is not optional based on PO size or retailer relationship &mdash; every shipment goes through the same checklist.</p>

          <p>We maintain the routing guide library for each retailer, update it when the guides change, and confirm ASN accuracy with the 3PL before the carrier pickup. We own the documentation package.</p>

          <p>Across the brands we&apos;ve worked with, most move from an estimated 3&ndash;6% first-year deduction rate to under 1% within an estimated two to three retail cycles &mdash; not because we fight more disputes, but because fewer chargeback-triggering events make it out of our pre-shipment process.</p>

          <h2 id="faq" className="b-faq-h">FAQ</h2>

          <h3>What is the most effective way to prevent retail chargebacks?</h3>
          <p>Run a documented pre-shipment audit before every PO. The four highest-impact categories are routing guide compliance, carton label accuracy, case pack configuration, and ASN timing. Checking these before the carrier picks up eliminates the vast majority of first-year deductions.</p>

          <h3>Which chargebacks should CPG brands dispute vs. absorb?</h3>
          <p>Dispute when the amount is material, the error is not yours, and you have documentation. Absorb when your team caused the violation, the amount is below your threshold, or you lack the evidence to win the dispute. Routing guide violations and labeling failures are almost always the vendor&apos;s error &mdash; absorb those and fix the process.</p>

          <h3>How long does it take to resolve a retail chargeback dispute?</h3>
          <p>Most retailers have 60&ndash;90 day dispute windows and 30&ndash;60 day resolution timelines once a dispute is submitted. Budget 8&ndash;12 hours of internal time per disputed deduction &mdash; documentation assembly, portal submission, and follow-up.</p>

          <h3>Why do routing guide chargebacks happen so frequently?</h3>
          <p>Routing guides change, and most brands do not download the current version before each PO. They use a saved file from the last shipment. Carrier approval lists, appointment requirements, and freight method specifications update quarterly. Pulling the current guide before every carrier booking is the single fastest fix for this category.</p>

          <h3>What documentation do I need to win a chargeback dispute?</h3>
          <p>The minimum package: ASN transmission timestamp, carrier appointment confirmation with DC appointment number, signed bill of lading, and photos of pallet build and carton labels taken before the load departed. Disputes submitted without specific documentation are rejected by most retailers on first review.</p>
