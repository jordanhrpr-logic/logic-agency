            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Getting into retail is a 12&ndash;18 month process for most CPG brands, not a shortcut or one-meeting win.</li>
              <li>The three main paths in are brokers, trade shows, and direct buyer outreach; each has different economics and timeline risk.</li>
              <li>Retail buyers evaluate more than product-market fit. They look at price architecture, packaging, supply capacity, margins, compliance, and proof you can ship.</li>
              <li>Wholesale economics are different from DTC: retailers often require an estimated 40&ndash;60% margin, which compresses brand gross margin unless COGS and freight are ready.</li>
              <li>The brands that win retail repeatedly prepare operations before the buyer says yes.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Getting products into retail stores is not a hack. It is a long sequence of decisions, documents, meetings, pricing work, operational setup, and compliance.</p>

          <p>Most articles on this topic focus on the pitch. The pitch matters. But the operational setup determines whether the first PO turns into a second.</p>

          <h2 id="retail-timeline">The Reality Check: Retail Is a 12&ndash;18 Month Operating Project</h2>

          <p>A realistic timeline looks like this:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Months 1&ndash;3:</strong> retail strategy, target account selection, price architecture, packaging review, sales materials</li>
            <li><strong>Months 3&ndash;6:</strong> broker conversations, trade show prep, buyer outreach, account mapping</li>
            <li><strong>Months 6&ndash;9:</strong> buyer meetings, sample submissions, assortment discussions, pricing negotiation</li>
            <li><strong>Months 9&ndash;12:</strong> vendor onboarding, EDI setup, item setup, packaging compliance, inventory planning</li>
            <li><strong>Months 12&ndash;18:</strong> first PO, first shipment, DC receiving, shelf set, sell-through monitoring, reorder planning</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some brands move faster. Many move slower. The point is not that 12&ndash;18 months is a rule. The point is that retail readiness work starts long before the PO.</p>

          <p>If a buyer says yes and the brand is not operationally ready, the opportunity turns into pressure. EDI has to be set up. Packaging has to meet requirements. Case packs have to be correct. The 3PL has to understand the retailer&apos;s routing guide. Inventory has to be available.</p>

          <p>That is why we treat retail entry as an operations problem, not only a sales problem.</p>

          <h2 id="three-paths-into-retail">The 3 Paths Into Retail Stores</h2>

          <p>There are three common paths into retail: broker, trade show, and direct pitch. None is automatically better. The right path depends on category, channel, stage, and team capacity.</p>

          <h3>Path 1: Retail Broker</h3>

          <p>A broker already has buyer relationships. They understand the retailer&apos;s category calendar, margin expectations, paperwork, and buying windows. Good brokers can shorten the relationship-building curve.</p>

          <p>The tradeoff is cost and control. Brokers often take an estimated 3&ndash;7% of sales, sometimes more depending on category and scope. Some also require monthly retainers. That can be worth it if the broker has direct access to the right buyer and category.</p>

          <p>Broker makes sense when:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You are targeting major retailers with structured category teams.</li>
            <li>Your internal team has limited retail experience.</li>
            <li>The category is relationship-heavy.</li>
            <li>You need help with buyer language, trade spend, and line reviews.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Broker does not make sense when the broker is generic, not category-specific, or cannot explain exactly which accounts they can influence.</p>

          <h3>Path 2: Trade Shows</h3>

          <p>Trade shows create buyer density. Expo West, Cosmoprof, SupplySide, ShopTalk, and category-specific shows can put a brand in front of buyers, brokers, distributors, and partners in a short window.</p>

          <p>The problem is that trade shows are noisy. A good booth does not replace a retail strategy. The brands that use trade shows well schedule meetings before the show, prepare retailer-specific sell sheets, and follow up within 48 hours.</p>

          <p>Trade shows make sense when:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You have a retail-ready product and packaging.</li>
            <li>You can articulate channel fit in one sentence.</li>
            <li>You have margins modeled for wholesale.</li>
            <li>You have samples, sell sheets, and operational proof ready.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Do not spend $30,000 on a show if you cannot answer basic retail questions about case pack, wholesale price, ship windows, and production capacity.</p>

          <h3>Path 3: Direct Buyer Pitch</h3>

          <p>Direct pitch works when the brand has a clear category fit, strong traction, and a specific reason the retailer should care now.</p>

          <p>The pitch should be short. Buyers do not need your full brand origin story. They need to know:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Why the product fits their customer</li>
            <li>What category problem it solves</li>
            <li>What proof exists from DTC or other channels</li>
            <li>How the price architecture works</li>
            <li>Whether the brand can support the account operationally</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Direct pitch is not cold email volume. It is targeted, category-specific outreach to the right buyer at the right time in the line review cycle.</p>

          <h2 id="what-buyers-evaluate">What Retail Buyers Actually Evaluate</h2>

          <p>Retail buyers evaluate the product. But they also evaluate the risk of doing business with the vendor.</p>

          <p>The product might be beautiful. The brand might have a strong DTC following. But if the packaging does not fit the shelf, the wholesale price does not support retailer margin, or the operation cannot ship cleanly, the buyer has a problem.</p>

          <h3>Category Fit</h3>

          <p>Does the product fill a real gap in the assortment? Is it meaningfully different from the products already on shelf? Does it expand the category, improve margin, bring a different customer, or replace a weaker SKU?</p>

          <h3>Sell-Through Proof</h3>

          <p>DTC revenue helps, but retail buyers care about velocity. They want to see evidence that customers buy the product without a founder explaining it. Strong proof can include DTC reorder rates, Amazon velocity, wholesale pilots, specialty retail sell-through, or regional chain performance.</p>

          <h3>Price Architecture</h3>

          <p>Retail price has to work at shelf. Wholesale price has to support retailer margin. COGS has to support brand margin after freight, deductions, and trade spend.</p>

          <p>If the math only works in DTC, the brand is not ready.</p>

          <h3>Packaging and Shelf Readiness</h3>

          <p>Retail packaging has to communicate fast. It has to fit the shelf, scan cleanly, hold up through distribution, and meet the retailer&apos;s item setup requirements.</p>

          <h3>Supply Capacity</h3>

          <p>Can the brand support the initial PO? Can it support the reorder? Can the factory handle the volume? Is there backup supply if demand exceeds forecast?</p>

          <p>Buyers do not want a product that sells out once and disappears.</p>

          <h2 id="vendor-onboarding">Vendor Onboarding: What Happens After the Buyer Says Yes</h2>

          <p>The buyer yes is not the finish line. It is the start of onboarding.</p>

          <p>Most brands underestimate this stage because it feels administrative. It is not. Vendor onboarding is where operational readiness gets tested.</p>

          <p>Common onboarding requirements include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Vendor master setup</li>
            <li>W-9, insurance, and compliance documents</li>
            <li>EDI trading partner setup</li>
            <li>Product/item setup</li>
            <li>GS1 UPC validation</li>
            <li>Case pack and carton data</li>
            <li>Pallet configuration</li>
            <li>Product images and copy</li>
            <li>Certificates, testing, or regulatory documentation</li>
            <li>Routing guide acknowledgement</li>
            <li>Chargeback policy acknowledgement</li>
            <li>Portal access and training</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This can take 30&ndash;90 days depending on retailer and brand preparedness. If the brand has the documents ready, onboarding moves. If the brand is building the documents after the buyer asks, the timeline slips.</p>

          <p>That delay matters because retail calendars are unforgiving. Miss a reset window and the next opportunity may be months away.</p>

          <h2 id="first-po-economics">First PO Economics: The Margin Math Most Articles Skip</h2>

          <p>DTC margin and retail margin are different businesses.</p>

          <p>In DTC, a brand might sell a product for $40 with a $12 landed cost. That looks like a 70% gross margin before fulfillment and marketing.</p>

          <p>In retail, the retailer may buy the same product for $20&ndash;$24 wholesale. If landed cost is still $12, the brand&apos;s gross margin drops to an estimated 40&ndash;50% before freight to the DC, chargebacks, co-op, markdowns, and payment terms.</p>

          <p>That is not automatically bad. Retail can create volume, awareness, credibility, and wholesale scale. But the math has to work before the PO.</p>

          <p>The common margin misses:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Retailer margin requirement of an estimated 40&ndash;60%</li>
            <li>Distributor margin if using a distributor</li>
            <li>Freight to retailer DC</li>
            <li>EDI and compliance costs</li>
            <li>Chargeback reserve of an estimated 2&ndash;5%</li>
            <li>Co-op advertising or promotional allowances</li>
            <li>Packaging upgrades required for retail</li>
            <li>Cash tied up in inventory before payment arrives</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A retail launch that looks profitable at the wholesale price can become thin once the operating costs are included.</p>

          <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes That Kill Retail Momentum</h2>

          <h3>Mistake 1: Pitching Before the Operation Is Ready</h3>

          <p>The buyer meeting goes well. The buyer asks for next steps. The brand says yes before realizing EDI, packaging, insurance, case packs, and item setup are not ready. Momentum turns into scramble.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 2: Keeping a DTC Price Structure</h3>

          <p>Retail needs a wholesale price that supports the retailer and the brand. If the brand has to raise MSRP, lower margin, or cut product quality to make retail work, the model needs to be rebuilt.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 3: Ignoring Case Pack and Pallet Math</h3>

          <p>Retailers care about how product moves through the DC and shelf. Wrong case packs create receiving friction, replenishment issues, and deductions.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 4: Choosing the Wrong First Retailer</h3>

          <p>The biggest logo is not always the best first account. A specialty retailer, regional chain, or smaller national account may be a cleaner proving ground before a mass-market rollout.</p>

          <h3>Mistake 5: Underestimating the First 90 Days</h3>

          <p>The first 90 days are not passive. The brand has to monitor sell-through, chargebacks, fill rate, inventory, replenishment, reviews, and buyer feedback.</p>

          <h2 id="retail-readiness">How to Know If You Are Ready for Retail</h2>

          <p>You are not retail-ready because you want a retail account. You are retail-ready when the systems can support the account.</p>

          <p>Use this quick filter:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Can you produce enough inventory for the first PO and a reorder?</li>
            <li>Can your margins work at wholesale pricing?</li>
            <li>Can your packaging meet shelf, scan, carton, and pallet requirements?</li>
            <li>Can your 3PL ship to retail DCs?</li>
            <li>Can you support EDI?</li>
            <li>Do you have insurance, compliance documents, and product data ready?</li>
            <li>Can you absorb 30&ndash;90 day payment terms?</li>
            <li>Do you know what chargebacks would do to your margin?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the answer is no on more than two of these, do the operations work before the pitch.</p>

          <h2 id="retail-packet">What to Build Before the First Buyer Meeting</h2>

          <p>The cleanest retail conversations happen when the brand can answer operational questions without pausing. Before the first serious buyer meeting, build a retail packet that proves the account can launch without creating work for the retailer.</p>

          <p>That packet should include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Current wholesale price list and suggested retail price</li>
            <li>Landed cost by SKU</li>
            <li>Gross margin by channel</li>
            <li>Case pack and pallet configuration</li>
            <li>GS1 UPC list</li>
            <li>Product dimensions and weights</li>
            <li>Shelf-ready packaging notes</li>
            <li>Production lead time by SKU</li>
            <li>Inventory available for first PO</li>
            <li>Reorder production plan</li>
            <li>Insurance and compliance documents</li>
            <li>3PL and EDI capability summary</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This does two things. First, it makes the buyer conversation better. Buyers do not want to drag operational answers out of a brand after the fact. Second, it protects the brand from saying yes to a retail opportunity that does not work financially or operationally.</p>

          <h2 id="when-retail-is-wrong">When Retail Is the Wrong Next Move</h2>

          <p>Some brands should not go into retail yet. That is not a failure. It is sequencing.</p>

          <p>Retail is probably too early if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>DTC demand is inconsistent and reorder rates are weak.</li>
            <li>Gross margin only works at full DTC price.</li>
            <li>Packaging is not retail-ready.</li>
            <li>The brand cannot fund inventory before payment arrives.</li>
            <li>No one owns operations internally.</li>
            <li>Lead times are unknown or unmanaged.</li>
            <li>The first retail PO would consume all available inventory.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In those cases, the better move is to fix the operating model first. Reduce COGS. Confirm packaging. Build supplier reliability. Tighten inventory planning. Then go to retail.</p>

          <p>Retail can accelerate a strong operation. It usually punishes a fragile one.</p>

          <h2 id="faq" className="b-faq-h">FAQ</h2>

          <h3>How long does it take to get products into retail stores?</h3>

          <p>Most CPG brands should plan for 12&ndash;18 months from retail strategy to first shipment. Some move faster, but national retail onboarding, buyer calendars, packaging, and compliance take time.</p>

          <h3>How do you sell products to Target or Walmart?</h3>

          <p>Most brands enter through a broker, trade show relationship, distributor, or direct buyer outreach. The product needs sell-through proof, wholesale pricing, retail-ready packaging, and vendor onboarding capability.</p>

          <h3>What do retail buyers look for in new products?</h3>

          <p>Buyers look for category fit, customer demand, price architecture, margin, packaging, production capacity, compliance readiness, and proof the brand can support the account.</p>

          <h3>How much margin do retailers take?</h3>

          <p>Retailers commonly require an estimated 40&ndash;60% margin depending on category, channel, and product type. Brands need to model wholesale margin after freight, deductions, chargebacks, and trade spend.</p>

          <h3>Should a small brand start with Target, Walmart, or Costco?</h3>

            { q: 'How long does it take to get products into retail stores?', a: 'Most CPG brands should plan for 12–18 months from retail strategy to first shipment. Some move faster, but national retail onboarding, buyer calendars, packaging, and compliance take time.' },
            { q: 'How do you sell products to Target or Walmart?', a: 'Most brands enter through a broker, trade show relationship, distributor, or direct buyer outreach. The product needs sell-through proof, wholesale pricing, retail-ready packaging, and vendor onboarding capability.' },
            { q: 'What do retail buyers look for in new products?', a: 'Buyers look for category fit, customer demand, price architecture, margin, packaging, production capacity, compliance readiness, and proof the brand can support the account.' },
            { q: 'How much margin do retailers take?', a: 'Retailers commonly require an estimated 40-60% margin depending on category, channel, and product type. Brands need to model wholesale margin after freight, deductions, chargebacks, and trade spend.' },
            { q: 'Should a small brand start with Target, Walmart, or Costco?', a: 'Not always. A smaller specialty retailer or regional chain can be a better first account if the brand needs proof, operational practice, and lower PO risk before a national rollout.' },
