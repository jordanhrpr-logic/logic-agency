            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Packaging cost should be evaluated as both per-unit spend and percentage of COGS.</li>
              <li>Most CPG brands land between an estimated 10&ndash;25% of COGS for packaging, but the healthy range depends on category and price point.</li>
              <li>Beauty, jewelry, fragrance, and spirits can support higher packaging costs because packaging carries more perceived value.</li>
              <li>Food, beverage, and supplements usually need tighter cost control because retail price points are lower.</li>
              <li>The cheapest package is not always the lowest-cost package once damage, returns, freight, storage, and brand erosion are included.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>Benchmarks are starting points. The right packaging cost is the one that protects margin and supports the brand promise at the same time.</p>

          <h2 id="how-to-think-about-it">How Should Brands Think About Packaging Cost?</h2>

          <p>Packaging cost has three layers.</p>

          <p>The first is direct unit cost. That is the number most brands ask for first: what does each box, carton, pouch, label, insert, or shipper cost?</p>

          <p>The second is landed cost. That includes freight, duties, storage, waste, and handling. A package that looks cheap at the factory can become expensive after ocean freight, dimensional weight, and warehouse space are added.</p>

          <p>The third is business impact. Packaging affects damage rates, retail acceptance, unboxing, shelf presence, perceived value, and repeat purchase. A lower unit cost can be a higher total cost if it causes returns or makes the product feel cheap.</p>

          <p>The benchmark only matters when you know what job the package is doing. A $10 box can be smart for a $150 fragrance. It can be reckless for a $19 supplement. A $0.60 carton can be efficient for a food product and underbuilt for a premium skincare retail launch.</p>

          <h2 id="benchmarks-by-category">Packaging Cost Per Unit Benchmarks by Category</h2>

          <p>These ranges reflect common packaging economics for growing brands. Low volume, domestic rush production, complex finishes, custom tooling, and luxury rigid formats can push costs above the high end.</p>

              <tr><th>Product Category</th><th>Typical Cost Per Unit</th><th>Healthy COGS Range</th><th>Common Cost Drivers</th></tr>

          </table>

          <p>The spread inside each category is wide because packaging is not one thing. A folding carton, rigid box, molded insert, label, cap, and shipper all behave differently in the cost model.</p>

          <h2 id="beauty">Beauty and Skincare Packaging: $1.50&ndash;$8.00 Per Unit</h2>

          <p>Beauty packaging carries brand value. The customer judges formula quality before using the product, and packaging is part of that judgment.</p>

          <p>Typical cost ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Folding carton: $0.50&ndash;$3.00</li>
            <li>Bottle, jar, or tube: $0.60&ndash;$4.00</li>
            <li>Airless component: $1.50&ndash;$6.00</li>
            <li>Rigid box or set box: $3.00&ndash;$15.00</li>
            <li>Labels, seals, and inserts: $0.10&ndash;$0.75</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A prestige serum can support a higher packaging percentage than a mass cleanser. The same carton that works for DTC may fail at retail if shelf presence, barcode placement, or case-pack structure is wrong.</p>

          <p>Beauty brands overpay when they stack too many finishes without a clear hierarchy. One signature finish usually does more than four competing effects.</p>

          <h2 id="food">Food and Beverage Packaging: $0.30&ndash;$3.00 Per Unit</h2>

          <p>Food and beverage packaging has less room for expensive decoration. Compliance, shelf life, barrier performance, and retail handling matter more than surface drama.</p>

          <p>Typical cost ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Labels: $0.05&ndash;$0.35</li>
            <li>Flexible pouches: $0.15&ndash;$0.80</li>
            <li>Bottles and jars: $0.30&ndash;$1.80</li>
            <li>Folding cartons: $0.30&ndash;$2.00</li>
            <li>Multipack carriers: $0.30&ndash;$2.50</li>
            <li>Corrugated shippers: $0.20&ndash;$1.50</li>
          </ul>

          <p>F&amp;B packaging often lands around an estimated 8&ndash;18% of COGS. Premium specialty products can go higher, but most brands need to protect margin with simple structures, efficient case packs, and strong compliance planning.</p>

          <p>The biggest cost mistake in F&amp;B is approving consumer-facing packaging without checking retail-ready case requirements. The package may look right and still fail the retail system.</p>

          <h2 id="supplements">Supplements Packaging: $0.80&ndash;$4.00 Per Unit</h2>

          <p>Supplements usually sit between food and beauty. The package has to feel credible, clean, and compliant, but the economics often require discipline.</p>

          <p>Typical cost ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Stock bottle and cap: $0.30&ndash;$1.20</li>
            <li>Custom bottle or jar: $0.80&ndash;$3.00</li>
            <li>Label: $0.05&ndash;$0.35</li>
            <li>Folding carton: $0.40&ndash;$2.00</li>
            <li>Tamper seal, insert, or scoop: $0.05&ndash;$0.50</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Supplement brands often overbuild secondary packaging too early. A carton may help retail presentation, but it also adds cost, freight volume, and inventory complexity. If retail is the channel, the carton may be worth it. If the product is still mostly DTC, the money may be better spent on a stronger label system, better component fit, or subscription shipping protection.</p>

          <h2 id="electronics">Consumer Electronics Packaging: $2.00&ndash;$12.00 Per Unit</h2>

          <p>Electronics packaging has to protect the product, present the tech clearly, and often carry accessories, manuals, cables, and inserts.</p>

          <p>Typical cost ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Folding carton: $0.80&ndash;$4.00</li>
            <li>Rigid box: $3.00&ndash;$12.00</li>
            <li>Molded pulp or paper insert: $0.40&ndash;$3.00</li>
            <li>Foam or engineered insert: $0.75&ndash;$5.00</li>
            <li>Corrugated shipper: $0.50&ndash;$3.00</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Protection is the biggest driver. A premium box that prevents damage can be cheaper than a lower-cost box that creates returns. Right-sizing also matters. Electronics packaging often leaks margin through dimensional weight. A smaller structure can lower freight without hurting the unboxing.</p>

          <h2 id="spirits-fragrance">Spirits, Wine, and Fragrance Packaging: $3.00&ndash;$25.00+</h2>

          <p>Spirits, wine, and fragrance packaging can support higher unit costs because the package is part of the giftable experience.</p>

          <p>Typical ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Premium labels: $0.15&ndash;$1.00</li>
            <li>Folding cartons: $1.00&ndash;$4.00</li>
            <li>Rigid bottle boxes: $3.00&ndash;$15.00</li>
            <li>Gift sets or coffrets: $8.00&ndash;$25.00+</li>
            <li>Protective shippers: $1.00&ndash;$6.00</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These categories justify premium packaging when the package supports price perception, shelf differentiation, or giftability. They do not justify waste by default.</p>

          <h2 id="jewelry">Jewelry Packaging: $3.00&ndash;$15.00 Per Unit</h2>

          <p>Jewelry brands often pay $6&ndash;$10 per box for catalog packaging without full customization. Custom packaging can land in a similar range when the structure, finish, and volume are planned correctly.</p>

          <p>Typical ranges:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Simple rigid jewelry box: $3.00&ndash;$6.00</li>
            <li>PU leather or linen-wrapped box: $5.00&ndash;$10.00</li>
            <li>Hinged box with hardware: $6.00&ndash;$15.00</li>
            <li>Velvet or custom insert: $0.50&ndash;$3.00</li>
            <li>Gift set or multi-piece kit: $8.00&ndash;$20.00+</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The cost driver is consistency across box sizes. Rings, earrings, necklaces, pendants, and bracelets often need different structures, but the materials and finishes need to match.</p>

          <h2 id="too-expensive">When Is Packaging Too Expensive?</h2>

          <p>Packaging is too expensive when it does not earn back its role in the product economics. Red flags:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Packaging exceeds 25% of COGS with no luxury or protection rationale.</li>
            <li>The box increases freight cost without improving protection or perceived value.</li>
            <li>Finish costs are stacked without a clear signature moment.</li>
            <li>MOQ forces more inventory than the brand can sell before the packaging changes.</li>
            <li>The package looks premium but fails retail compliance or damage testing.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A high packaging cost can be correct. A low packaging cost can be wrong. The question is whether the package supports the margin model.</p>

          <h2 id="cheap-costs-more">When Does Cheap Packaging Cost More?</h2>

          <p>Cheap packaging gets expensive when it creates downstream costs. Common examples:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Higher damage rates</li>
            <li>More returns</li>
            <li>Lower retail acceptance</li>
            <li>Poor unboxing experience</li>
            <li>More customer complaints</li>
            <li>Higher freight from wrong sizing</li>
            <li>Reorders delayed by bad supplier setup</li>
            <li>Brand perception that does not match price point</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A $0.40 savings is not a savings if it creates a $6 return, a damaged retail relationship, or a customer who never reorders. The best packaging cost model includes unit cost, landed cost, damage risk, shelf performance, and brand role.</p>

          <h2 id="packaging-layers">Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Packaging Change the Benchmark</h2>

          <p>A cost benchmark is only useful if everyone is talking about the same layer of packaging.</p>

          <p>Primary packaging touches or directly contains the product: bottles, jars, tubes, pouches, caps, pumps, and labels usually sit here.</p>

          <p>Secondary packaging is the branded structure around the primary package: folding cartons, rigid boxes, set boxes, sleeves, inserts, and retail gift boxes usually sit here.</p>

          <p>Tertiary packaging protects and moves the product through the supply chain: shippers, master cartons, dividers, pallets, corner boards, and retail-ready cases sit here.</p>

          <p>A beauty brand may say packaging costs $4 per unit, but that could mean primary only, secondary only, or the full system. For clean benchmarking, separate the layers first. Then calculate total landed packaging cost.</p>

          <h2 id="volume-effect">How Volume Changes Packaging Benchmarks</h2>

          <p>Volume changes almost every packaging benchmark. At low volume, setup costs dominate. Tooling, print setup, material minimums, and freight get spread across fewer units. At higher volume, the unit cost improves, but inventory risk can rise.</p>

          <p>Example: 1,000 units at $3.20 may be the right test order; 5,000 units at $1.85 may be the better production order; 20,000 units at $1.10 may be efficient only if sell-through is proven. The best benchmark is not always the lowest quote. It is the number that matches the stage of the product.</p>

          <p>A launch SKU, retail test, and replenishment SKU should not be judged the same way. Launch packaging needs flexibility. Replenishment packaging needs efficiency. Retail packaging needs consistency and compliance.</p>

          <h2 id="using-benchmarks">How Should Brands Use These Benchmarks in a Real Quote Review?</h2>

          <p>Use benchmarks as a pressure test. If a skincare carton quote is $7.50 before the primary component, something in the structure, finish, volume, or supplier markup needs review. If a rigid jewelry box quote is $2.00 with custom hardware and low volume, the quote may be missing real costs.</p>

          <p>Ask what is included. Primary packaging, secondary packaging, tertiary packaging, freight, duties, storage, and waste are often quoted separately. A clean benchmark compares the same scope across suppliers.</p>

          <p>The strongest quote review separates three questions: is the package right for the brand, is the cost right for the margin, and is the supplier set up to repeat it reliably?</p>

          <h2 id="faq" className="b-faq-h">FAQ</h2>

          <h3>What percentage of COGS should packaging be?</h3>
          <p>Most growing CPG brands should expect packaging to represent an estimated 10&ndash;25% of COGS. The right range depends on category, channel, price point, fragility, and brand positioning.</p>

          <h3>How much should beauty packaging cost per unit?</h3>
          <p>Beauty and skincare packaging usually costs $1.50&ndash;$8.00 per unit, with luxury rigid boxes, fragrance coffrets, and premium gift sets often reaching $15&ndash;$25+.</p>

          <h3>What is a normal packaging cost for food products?</h3>
          <p>Food and beverage packaging often lands around $0.30&ndash;$3.00 per unit, depending on pouches, bottles, cartons, labels, barrier needs, and retail case-pack requirements. Food packaging typically represents an estimated 8&ndash;18% of COGS.</p>

          <h3>Is cheaper packaging always better?</h3>
          <p>No. Cheaper packaging can increase damage, returns, freight cost, retail compliance issues, or brand erosion. A $0.40 savings is not a savings if it creates a $6 return, a damaged retail relationship, or a customer who never reorders.</p>

          <h3>How do I know if I am overpaying for packaging?</h3>
          <p>Look for packaging that exceeds 25% of COGS with no luxury or protection rationale, unnecessary finishes stacked without a clear signature moment, oversized structures that inflate freight, supplier markups, and MOQs that force excess inventory.</p>

          <h3>How does volume affect packaging cost per unit?</h3>
          <p>Volume changes almost every packaging benchmark. At low volume, setup costs dominate. At 1,000 units a box might cost $3.20; at 5,000 units it might fall to $1.85; at 20,000 units to $1.10. The best benchmark is the number that matches the stage of the product, not always the lowest quote.</p>
