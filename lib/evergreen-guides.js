    faq: [
      { q: 'What is the difference between recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable packaging?', a: 'Recyclable means the packaging can be collected, sorted, and re-processed into new material through existing infrastructure — verified against the standard set by How2Recycle in the US. Compostable means the packaging breaks down into biological material under specific conditions (industrial composting under ASTM D6400 or D6868, or home composting under stricter standards). Biodegradable is a broader term the FTC now discourages because it lacks specific meaning — the FTC requires proof of complete biodegradation within one year in the "customary disposal environment," which for most packaging is a landfill where almost nothing biodegrades in that timeframe.' },
      { q: 'How much does PCR packaging cost compared to virgin?', a: 'Post-consumer recycled resin typically costs 8 to 25 percent more than virgin resin, depending on the resin type, PCR percentage, and market conditions. PCR PET at 30% is the most common first move and usually adds $0.03 to $0.08 per bottle at typical CPG volumes. PCR HDPE and PP run higher, and higher PCR percentages (50%, 75%, 100%) carry non-linear cost increases and often color-consistency limitations. Total landed cost impact — including any downgrade in decoration or line efficiency — is what you should model, not the resin premium alone.' },
      { q: 'Which states have packaging EPR laws?', a: 'As of 2026, five states have enacted EPR laws for packaging: California (SB 54), Colorado (HB 22-1355), Maine (LD 1541), Oregon (SB 582), and Minnesota (HF 3577). Colorado and Oregon began collecting producer fees in July 2025. California\'s fees phase in through 2027-2032. Producer registration deadlines and fee schedules vary state to state, but any brand doing more than $1-5M in gross revenue in these states typically qualifies as a "covered producer." Washington, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have active legislation and are likely to pass similar laws by 2028.' },
      { q: 'What is the FTC Green Guides update and why does it matter?', a: 'The FTC updated the Green Guides in 2023-2024 to tighten enforcement of environmental marketing claims. The most impactful changes: unqualified "recyclable" claims now require that a substantial majority of consumers (60% or more) have access to recycling for the material and that the entire package as sold is recyclable — not just the base substrate. Compostable claims now require ASTM D6400 or D6868 certification and disclosure of whether industrial or home composting applies. General claims like "eco-friendly" or "sustainable" require specific measurable substantiation. Multiple state AGs are actively enforcing these standards, and class-action firms have made packaging claims a specialty. Any claim on the package or website should be reviewed by legal against substantiation from packaging engineering before printing.' },
      { q: 'What is a mono-material laminate and why do retailers prefer it?', a: 'Traditional flexible packaging — the pouches most snack, supplement, and personal-care brands use — is made from multiple laminated layers (typically PET/AL/PE) that cannot be recycled in any curbside program because the layers cannot be separated. Mono-material laminates use a single resin family (all-PE, all-PP, or all-PET) with barrier coatings, which allows the pouch to be recycled through emerging store drop-off programs and eventually curbside. Retailers prefer them because they score on sustainability rubrics and reduce EPR fees. The tradeoff: barrier performance is different, so oxygen-sensitive products often require shelf-life revalidation, and mono-material films run $0.02-0.06 more per pouch at typical volumes.' },
      { q: 'How does refillable packaging actually work economically?', a: 'Refillable packaging works economically in three contexts: (1) high-price-per-unit categories where the primary container is expensive and refills are cheaper — luxury skincare, prestige fragrance, premium home fragrance; (2) subscription models with direct-to-consumer reverse logistics; and (3) in-store refill stations at retailers with existing sustainability programs (Whole Foods, some Sephora locations). Outside these contexts, the reverse logistics cost, consumer return rates (8-40% depending on channel), and quality control on returned containers usually break the economics for lower-price-per-unit CPG. Brands that succeed with refill typically spend 3-9 months building the operational model before launching to consumers.' },
      { q: 'Do retailers actually delist products for non-sustainable packaging?', a: 'Delisting purely for packaging is rare. What is common: (1) failing to qualify for new-item slots in the first place because your scorecard is below the buyer\'s threshold, (2) losing preferential shelf placement or "clean/conscious" badges that drive category velocity, (3) paying higher slotting or sustainability fees, and (4) being deprioritized in category resets when a competitor with better packaging enters. The financial impact of not qualifying for Sephora Clean+Planet Positive or Target Zero, for example, often exceeds the redesign cost within 12-18 months in that channel.' },
      { q: 'How long does a full packaging sustainability redesign take?', a: 'A single-SKU PCR conversion on existing tooling: 8-16 weeks including validation. A mono-material laminate redesign: 4-6 months including shelf-life revalidation. A structural redesign to a fully recyclable format: 6-9 months including tooling. A refillable system launch: 6-12 months including reverse logistics build. The brands that ship on the shorter end of these ranges are the ones that pick a sequenced approach — highest-impact SKU first, learn, then scale — rather than trying to redesign the entire portfolio in one initiative.' },
    ],
    keyTakeaways: [
      'PCR conversion on existing tooling is almost always the highest-impact, lowest-drag first move. Ship it, then move to the next material decision.',
      'EPR fees are real, escalating, and already being collected in Colorado and Oregon. Register, model your liability, and design to lower fee tiers.',

      'Every sustainability claim on the package or website is a legal artifact. FTC Green Guides and state AGs are actively enforcing.',

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is the difference between KeHE and UNFI?', a: 'Both are national wholesale distributors serving natural, specialty, and increasingly conventional grocery. KeHE runs ~6 DCs and ~35,000 retail locations, with a strong presence in specialty, gourmet, and independent natural. UNFI runs 30+ DCs and ~40,000 retail locations, is the primary distributor to Whole Foods (majority-supply agreement), and covers natural, organic, and conventional. Category-review timing differs (KeHE Jan/Jul, UNFI Feb/Aug). Most emerging CPG brands eventually list with both, but pitching them requires the right door: KeHE via RangeMe, UNFI via ECRM/PromoMash. New-item slotting fees run $150–500 per SKU per DC at KeHE, $200–750 per SKU per DC at UNFI, though negotiation and buyer sponsorship can move these numbers meaningfully.' },
      { q: 'How long does it take to get onboarded with KeHE or UNFI?', a: 'From "yes" from a buyer to first shipment: 8-14 weeks if your packaging, labeling, certifications, and vendor documents are ready. From cold pitch to first shipment: typically 6-9 months because you have to hit a category review window. The category review calendar controls everything — KeHE reviews in January and July, UNFI in February and August. Miss a window and your realistic first-shipment date pushes 6 months. Plan production, cash, and packaging changes against that rhythm rather than an aspirational timeline.' },
      { q: 'What are typical distributor slotting fees for a new CPG brand?', a: 'KeHE new-item slotting typically runs $150-500 per SKU per DC, with 6 DCs national. UNFI runs $200-750 per SKU per DC across 30+ DCs. Regional distributors are often lower and more negotiable. Slotting is sometimes waived for high-conviction items with strong buyer sponsorship, but plan on it as a real cost. Beyond slotting, budget for free-fill (1-3 cases per SKU per DC free), MCB promotional pricing ($1-3 per case for run-rate promotions), data platform fees (RangeMe Pro $1,200/yr, SPINS syndication $400+/mo), and EDI setup ($800 setup + $200/month for SPS Commerce or equivalent). A brand entering both KeHE and UNFI with 6 SKUs should budget $30-90K for the first year of distribution costs before broker fees.' },
      { q: 'What is the category review calendar for KeHE and UNFI?', a: 'KeHE runs its Selling Shows in January (spring/summer reset) and July (fall/holiday/winter reset), with selection decisions in the 4-6 weeks after each show. UNFI runs its Winter/Spring show in February (aligned with Whole Foods regional and global reviews) and its Fall show in August. Both align with Natural Products Expo West (Anaheim, March) and Expo East (September), which are not category reviews themselves but the largest single opportunities to meet distributor and retailer buyers face to face. Regional distributors (DPI, BiRite, Alpine, Palko, Nassau Candy) operate on rolling calendars and can move faster to a first PO, though usually at smaller commitment volumes.' },
      { q: 'Do I need a broker to sell into KeHE or UNFI?', a: 'Not required, but often decisive for emerging brands. Brokers provide buyer relationships, category expertise, retailer field support, and administrative coverage on promotional programs. Natural-channel brokers typically charge $1,500-5,000/month retainer plus 3-5% commission on shipments. The question is whether the broker earns their fee through incremental buyer meetings, faster onboarding, and better promotional execution. Brands under $2M in distributor sales often can direct-sell KeHE/UNFI with a focused in-house effort. Above that, broker economics usually work if the broker is a fit for your category. Covered in depth in our <a href="/guides/cpg-broker-selection-playbook">broker selection playbook</a>.' },
      { q: 'What is MCB (Manufacturer Chargeback) in distributor pricing?', a: 'MCB is the primary mechanism for running promotions through a distributor. You publish a promotional price on a KeHE bulletin, UNFI E-Note, or similar; the distributor bills you back the discount on cases sold at the promotional price. Typical MCB rates run $1-3 per case for run-rate promotions, higher for launch or reset promotions. MCB shows up as a deduction on your invoice — track it, verify against actual case-count reports from the distributor, and dispute discrepancies. Unreconciled MCB is a common source of margin leakage for growing brands.' },
      { q: 'What is EDI and do small brands really need it?', a: 'EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is the messaging protocol distributors and retailers use to exchange purchase orders, acknowledgments, shipping notices, and invoices. The core transactions for CPG distribution are 850 (PO), 855 (PO ack), 856 (ASN — advance ship notice), and 810 (invoice). Manual processing works up to about $50K/month of distributor volume; beyond that, chargebacks for late ASN, incorrect ASN, or late invoice will exceed the SPS Commerce or TrueCommerce subscription (~$200-400/month). Setting up EDI takes 4-8 weeks and costs $500-1,500 one-time. Once live, it eliminates a large class of chargebacks and frees your team from manual PO processing.' },
      { q: 'What sell-through data do buyers expect from CPG brands?', a: 'Buyers in natural and specialty grocery expect SPINS or IRI/Nielsen syndicated data for meaningful category conversations. SPINS covers the natural channel best and starts around $400/month depending on scope. Before you have 12+ weeks of retail sell-through, category conversations are qualitative — brand story, differentiation, packaging. Once you have data, conversations become quantitative — velocity per store per week, dollar sales growth, share of segment, promotional lift. Reaching that data threshold is usually the second-most-important milestone after acceptance itself.' },

      'Slotting is the tip of the cost iceberg. Free-fill, MCB, data platforms, EDI, and broker retainers add up to $30–90K in Y1 for a 6-SKU launch across two national distributors.',
      'The new-item form is the gatekeeper. UPCs, case pack, pallet config, certifications, code dates, and story fields all must match on submission.',
      'The first 90 days after acceptance decide whether the second review earns reorders or a slot deletion. Support the launch to prove velocity above category norms.',
      'EDI is non-negotiable above ~$50K/month of distributor volume. Chargeback exposure dwarfs the subscription cost.',

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is a typical CPG gross margin range?', a: 'Gross margin depends on channel. Direct-to-consumer typically runs 60-70%, Amazon FBA 25-45%, wholesale to independent retail 25-40%, wholesale to national retail (Target/Walmart) 15-35%, national distributors (KeHE/UNFI) 10-25%, and international distributors 8-20%. Blended gross margin for a scaling CPG brand at $10M revenue with a mix of channels typically lands between 35% and 55%. The single most important number is contribution margin per channel — gross margin minus channel-specific variable costs (fulfillment, ad spend, deductions, chargebacks) — because that determines whether a channel is actually profitable to scale.' },
      { q: 'How do I calculate true landed cost for CPG?', a: 'Landed cost is manufacturer cost (FOB or ex-works) plus ocean/air freight allocation per unit, plus duty (rate depends on HTS classification), plus customs broker and clearance fees, plus drayage and inbound trucking to your 3PL, plus 3PL receiving and putaway, plus tooling amortization spread over expected annual units, plus any quality control or inspection costs. For a typical overseas-sourced CPG product, landed cost runs 15-40% above the supplier PO price. Brands that quote gross margin from supplier PO price are typically overstating margin by 5-10 percentage points.' },
      { q: 'What are retail deductions and why do they matter?', a: 'Deductions are amounts retailers or distributors subtract from your invoices before paying — for things like promotional pricing (MCB), routing-guide violations, OTIF penalties, damages and shortages, slotting amortization, coop and MDF programs, free-fill, and historical post-audit adjustments. For a scaling wholesale brand, deductions typically consume 8-18% of gross wholesale revenue. Most brands never disaggregate deductions by category, so they cannot see which retailer, which operational failure, or which promotional program is actually the leak. The disaggregation exercise — coding 12 months of remittance detail into categories — is the first step in any margin recovery.' },
      { q: 'How much can DIM weight optimization save on parcel freight?', a: 'DIM weight optimization typically recovers 8-20% of parcel freight spend for CPG brands. The mechanism: parcel carriers price the larger of actual weight and dimensional weight (L × W × H / divisor). Most brands ship in 3-5 standard box sizes when 8-12 would fit product more tightly. Right-sizing boxes and replacing void fill (air pillows, paper) with die-cut inserts or tighter packouts reduces DIM weight without increasing damage rate. On a brand doing $1M/year in parcel freight, that is $80K-200K/year recovered. The engagement to implement typically runs 60-90 days.' },
      { q: 'What is contribution margin and how is it different from gross margin?', a: 'Gross margin is net revenue minus COGS (product plus inbound freight). Contribution margin is gross margin minus channel-variable costs: outbound freight, fulfillment, ad spend, promotional deductions, chargebacks. Contribution margin is the number that determines whether a channel is actually profitable to scale. A brand can have 45% Amazon FBA gross margin and negative contribution margin after PPC ad spend; a brand can have 22% distributor gross margin and healthy contribution margin because chargebacks are low and freight scales down. Investors and lenders increasingly look at contribution margin by channel rather than blended gross, because it tells them where growth is actually creating value.' },
      { q: 'What is MCB and how do I manage it?', a: 'MCB (Manufacturer Chargeback) is the mechanism for running promotions through a distributor. You publish a promotional price on a KeHE bulletin or UNFI E-Note; the distributor bills you back the discount on cases sold at the promotional price. Typical MCB runs $1-3 per case for run-rate promotions. Managing MCB well requires: (1) a trade-spend calendar with pre-committed budget per account, (2) verification of MCB against actual case-count reports from the distributor before accepting the deduction, (3) 60-day post-promo ROI review, and (4) killing or renegotiating promotions that fail to lift velocity 20%+. Unreconciled and unchallenged MCB is one of the most common margin leaks for growing wholesale brands.' },
      { q: 'When should I rebid my 3PL contract?', a: 'Every 18-24 months. Rates rise on contract renewals and never come back down without pressure. A rebid typically recovers 5-15% on pick-pack fees and 3-8% on storage, even when you stay with the incumbent. The rebid process itself takes 8-12 weeks: pull 6 months of activity data (orders, units, storage, receipts), issue an RFP to 3-5 3PLs, evaluate on pricing, service, tech integration, and geography, and negotiate. Even brands that stay with the incumbent gain leverage on the renewal terms.' },
      { q: 'What does "OTIF chargeback" mean and how do I prevent it?', a: 'OTIF (On-Time In-Full) is the retailer measurement of whether your shipments arrive at the appointed window with the full quantity ordered. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and others charge back a percentage of the shipment value for OTIF failures — typically 3% of the shipment for late, plus 3% for short. Prevention requires: (1) production and inventory planning that keeps safety stock at retailer-specific coverage levels, (2) automated ASN generation triggered by pack list, filed within the required window, (3) 3PL SLAs that make the 3PL responsible for on-window carrier pickup, and (4) monthly OTIF scorecard review with root-cause coding for every failure. Brands that hit sustained OTIF above 95% typically pay less than 0.5% of gross in OTIF chargebacks; brands running 85-90% OTIF often pay 3-5%.' },

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is the difference between a co-manufacturer and a co-packer?', a: 'A co-packer typically packages and labels product to your specification — either from bulk you supply or from ingredients they source separately. A co-manufacturer typically also manufactures the product itself, which may include formulation support, procurement, and packaging as a bundled service. Contract manufacturer is a broader term often used for full-service arrangements including regulatory and formulation. Private-label manufacturer means you brand an existing formulation. The right term matters because it defines who owns formulation IP, who bears raw material risk, who owns tooling, and who is responsible for regulatory compliance. Get this defined in the contract before you sign.' },
      { q: 'What is a typical co-manufacturer MOQ?', a: 'MOQ varies widely by category. Beverage bottling typically runs 5,000-20,000 units per SKU (mobile canning as low as 1,500). Formulated skincare and cosmetics 3,000-15,000 units. Supplements 5,000-25,000 bottles for capsules, 10,000-50,000 for gummies. Packaged snacks 10,000-50,000 units. Frozen and refrigerated food 5,000-20,000. Below MOQ, expect setup fees ($500-15,000) or per-unit premiums of 15-40%. Model the total cash commitment (units × landed cost) against your sell-through velocity before defaulting to "hit the MOQ to get the lower per-unit price" — MOQ carrying cost is often the largest hidden cost of scaling production.' },
      { q: 'How many co-manufacturers should I evaluate?', a: 'Screen 8-12 candidates on paper, RFQ 4-6, plant-visit 3, and award to 1 (or occasionally 2 for capacity redundancy). Anything less than 4-6 RFQs is anecdotal comparison. Anything more burns weeks of team time on candidates that were never realistic. Give each RFQ candidate the same brief and the same 3-week deadline. Candidates that cannot return a serious quote in 3 weeks cannot run a serious production.' },
      { q: 'How do I evaluate total landed cost across multiple co-manufacturer quotes?', a: 'Total landed cost = per-unit FOB + setup and tooling amortized over the run + freight from plant to your DCs + payment terms cash cost (a 50%-deposit / Net 30 arrangement carries real working-capital cost vs Net 45) + testing and QC + any regulatory or certification costs. On a real 3-way comparison we\'ve run, the lowest per-unit price finished third on total landed cost, driven by freight lane and setup fees. Build the comparison in a spreadsheet with all lines visible before deciding.' },
      { q: 'What certifications should a co-manufacturer have?', a: 'Category-dependent. Food and beverage: SQF or BRCGS third-party audit, FDA facility registration, organic certification (from CCOF, QAI, or Oregon Tilth if applicable), non-GMO Project verification, kosher/halal as applicable, allergen control program. Supplements: cGMP compliant per 21 CFR Part 111, FDA facility registration, NSF or USP for enhanced quality claims. Cosmetics: ISO 22716 (cosmetics GMP), FDA registration for OTC drug categories, organic certification, EU cosmetics compliance if selling internationally. Consumer hardware: ISO 9001 minimum, ISO 14001 for environmental, category-specific (FCC, UL, CE, RoHS). Ask for the current cert list up front and verify against certifying-body databases directly.' },
      { q: 'How do I do a reference check on a co-manufacturer?', a: 'Ask the reference customer specifically about (1) the last delivery miss and how it was handled, (2) the last quality issue and the root cause and corrective action, (3) the last time the reference customer\'s forecast moved significantly, and (4) whether the reference would sole-source their production to this co-manufacturer today. Vague positive answers or "everything is great" responses either mean the reference is coached, is new to the co-man, or is not close enough to production to be a useful reference. If the reference cannot name a single hard moment across 12+ months of production, ask for a different reference.' },
      { q: 'How do I handle capacity commitments with a co-manufacturer?', a: 'Get capacity commitment in writing as part of the contract, not the RFQ. Specify: allocated line hours per month, minimum notice period for capacity requests, right-of-first-refusal on additional capacity, and consequences for allocation misses. "We\'ll fit you in" is not a capacity plan — it is a promise to deprioritize you when a larger customer\'s order arrives. For scaling brands, capacity commitment is often more important than price.' },
      { q: 'When should a growing brand switch co-manufacturers?', a: 'Consider a change when the current partner shows repeated quality failures without corrective action, capacity constraints capping your growth, structurally bad economics that no negotiation can fix, or an operating rhythm that consistently generates surprises. Switching costs are real — new production validation, potential formula reformulation, tooling migration, inventory bridge — so run the full economics before deciding. But the cost of staying with a co-man that is limiting growth typically exceeds the cost of switching within 6-12 months. Add capacity through a second co-man before fully transitioning; sole-sourcing during a switch creates single-point-of-failure risk.' },

      { q: 'What is a good demand forecast accuracy for a CPG brand?', a: 'MAPE (Mean Absolute Percent Error) in the 15-25% range is typical for scaling CPG brands with 12+ months of sales history on mature SKUs. Below 10% is excellent and usually only achievable on high-velocity, low-variability items. Above 35% suggests the forecast is either losing predictive power (data problem) or being systematically overridden (discipline problem). Track MAPE monthly per SKU, weighted by revenue for a portfolio view, and pair it with bias to distinguish variance problems from over/under-forecasting problems.' },
      { q: 'How do I calculate safety stock for a CPG brand?', a: 'The most reliable formula for growing CPG brands is: Safety Stock = (Max Daily Sales × Max Lead Time) − (Avg Daily Sales × Avg Lead Time). Use rolling averages (last 90 days for daily sales, last 4 production runs for lead time). More sophisticated statistical models (service-level based, using standard deviation) exist, but max-max minus avg-avg is defensible and matches how retail buyers actually think about coverage. Higher lead time variability or higher demand variability both drive safety stock up; reducing either lowers safety stock without reducing service level.' },
      { q: 'What is a reorder point?', a: 'The inventory level at which you place your next production or purchase order. Formula: Reorder Point = (Average Daily Sales × Average Lead Time) + Safety Stock. When on-hand inventory drops to this level, place the next order. Set reorder points per SKU, not blended. Review quarterly as sales velocity and lead times change.' },
      { q: 'What is S&OP and does a small CPG brand need it?', a: 'S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning) is the recurring monthly rhythm that reconciles demand plans (what sales expects to sell) with supply plans (what ops can produce and ship) and financial plans (what cash the company can support). It does not require enterprise software — a monthly meeting with sales lead, ops lead, and finance lead, with an updated forecast, a production plan, and a cash plan produced and approved each time, is real S&OP. Brands under $2M can often get by with weekly ops standups and quarterly executive reviews; brands above $5M and multi-channel benefit meaningfully from a formal monthly cadence.' },
      { q: 'When should I move off spreadsheets for demand planning?', a: 'Move to a purpose-built demand planning tool (Cogsy, Streamline, Netstock, Genlogs) when your SKU count exceeds ~30, your channel count exceeds 3, or your monthly S&OP cycle takes more than 4-6 hours of manual spreadsheet work. Typical tool cost is $200-2,000/month. Move to ERP-integrated planning (NetSuite, Cin7 Omni, Acumatica) at $25M+ revenue where multi-facility, multi-entity complexity exceeds spreadsheet and standalone tool capability. Most brands wait too long on spreadsheets; the migration is easier at $10M than at $30M.' },
      { q: 'How often should I update my forecast?', a: 'The primary forecast update is monthly, run through the executive S&OP cadence. Weekly ops standups adjust production and inventory decisions inside the current month. Quarterly forecast accuracy reviews look back at MAPE by SKU and identify process improvements. Ad-hoc updates happen when a major event changes assumptions materially — a retailer confirms or cancels a reset, a promotional program approves or rejects, a supplier signals capacity change. The point is not more frequent updates; it is disciplined, logged updates on a predictable cadence.' },
      { q: 'How do I forecast a brand-new SKU?', a: 'New-SKU forecasts are always wrong — the question is how you build them so the error is bounded. Build a base case from category benchmarks (velocity per store per week for similar items), a customer commitment case (POs in hand plus expected reorder), and an aspirational case (what the plan says). Present the range, not a single number. Update aggressively during the first 90 days as real sell-through data arrives. Expect MAPE in the 30-50% range for the first 60 days; drop to 20-30% as history builds; converge on portfolio MAPE by month 6 for most categories.' },
      { q: 'How does demand forecasting affect working capital?', a: 'The forecast drives the production plan, which drives the cash-out timeline for materials, production, and freight, which drives the cash-in timeline based on channel-specific payment terms. A 90-day production lead time on a co-manufactured product with Net 30 supplier terms and Net 45 distributor receivables creates a 165-day cash cycle from PO to cash. Over-forecasting produces excess inventory that ties up cash; under-forecasting produces stockouts that lose revenue and — at scale — retailer chargebacks. Working capital planning is the direct downstream output of a disciplined forecast. Covered in depth in our <a href="/guides/cpg-working-capital-playbook">CPG Working Capital Playbook</a>.' },

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is a typical CPG broker commission rate?', a: 'Standard broker commission ranges: 3-5% for natural and specialty channel, 5-7% for conventional grocery, 7-10% for foodservice or category-specialized representation. Retainer structures typically add $1,500-5,000/month on top of commission for high-touch relationships or launch-phase engagements. National broker agencies (Advantage Solutions, Acosta, CROSSMARK) sometimes negotiate blended structures for scale. The right structure depends on your stage, category, and the level of field execution you need — a retainer + reduced commission often works for launches; pure commission works for mature brands with volume.' },
      { q: 'Do CPG brands really need a broker?', a: 'Not always. Brokers add value when you need buyer meetings you cannot get directly, field execution you cannot staff (retailer resets, demos, competitive audits), or specialized channel expertise (foodservice, natural, conventional, DSD). Brokers do not add value when your sales are concentrated in 1-2 retailers you already have direct relationships with, your founder is the sales function, or you are pre-launch without inventory and category story to support broker effort. Test the with-broker vs without-broker economics on incremental revenue and retention before signing.' },
      { q: 'How do I choose between a national broker and a specialty broker?', a: 'National brokers (Advantage Solutions, Acosta, CROSSMARK) have field team footprint across the country and work best for brands doing $10M+ in wholesale with multi-retailer reach. They provide breadth. Specialty brokers (Presence Marketing, Continental Sales, Green Spoon Sales for natural; regional operators for specific channels) provide depth in a specific channel or category. Emerging brands almost always start with specialty brokers for launch and category focus, then add national broker capability as they scale. Some brands run hybrid — specialty broker for natural channel, national broker for conventional.' },
      { q: 'What should be in a broker agreement?', a: 'Scope of representation (retailers or channels included/excluded), commission rate and payment terms, retainer amount and payment terms, term length and renewal, termination provisions (notice period, residual commission), performance milestones (optional but useful), reporting cadence and format, promotional support obligations, and account exclusivity or non-compete terms. The two most-negotiated items: performance milestones (does the broker have a performance floor they must meet) and residual commission (how long after termination do you owe commission on business already in the pipeline). Standard notice is 90 days; standard residual period is 30-90 days on business already booked.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between a broker and a sales rep?', a: 'A broker is typically an independent agency representing multiple non-competing brands, paid on commission or retainer + commission by the brand. A sales rep is typically an employee of the brand, salaried plus incentive, focused exclusively on that brand\'s accounts. Brokers scale better in early stages (variable cost, broad relationships); in-house sales teams scale better at $20M+ concentrated in 2-4 large accounts (accountability, brand focus, career progression). Many mid-scale brands run hybrid — in-house sales team on top accounts, broker representation everywhere else.' },
      { q: 'How do I know if my broker is underperforming?', a: 'Track specific milestones: buyer meetings booked and held per month, new-item submissions in flight, reset coverage completed, promotional calendar adherence, deduction disputes filed and won, retailer PO growth on covered accounts. Grade against pre-agreed milestones monthly for the first 90 days and quarterly after. Underperformance signals: missed meetings, retailer feedback that the broker is absent, MCB unreconciled, new-item paperwork errors, promotional programs missed. If two consecutive quarters miss milestones without a credible corrective plan, transition planning should begin.' },
      { q: 'How do I fire a broker without losing retailer relationships?', a: 'Give the contractual notice (typically 90 days written), define account transitions before notifying the retailer, notify buyers directly with a short professional note introducing the new representation, pay any residual commission owed on business in the pipeline, and close out MCB and deduction reconciliation cleanly. The broker network is small and talks — a clean exit preserves your reputation and your retailer relationships. A messy exit costs you shelf space and creates disputes that can outlast the relationship itself.' },
      { q: 'What are the top natural channel brokers in the US?', a: 'Leading natural and specialty channel brokers include Presence Marketing (extensive Whole Foods coverage), Continental Sales, Naturally Chicago, Green Spoon Sales (West Coast focus), Rainforest (specialty and specialty grocery), and dozens of strong regional operators. Each has category strengths and retailer relationship strengths — the right broker for beauty is not the right broker for supplements is not the right broker for beverage. Ask any distributor buyer for their honest read on the brokers active in their category; the answers are consistent and informative.' },

    faq: [
      { q: 'Who should own the tooling in a co-manufacturing relationship?', a: 'You, if you paid for it. Even when the tooling physically lives at the co-manufacturer\'s plant, your contract should establish that you own the tooling — molds, dies, plates, custom equipment — with a documented tooling schedule listing cost, unique identifier, and current location. Include the right to relocate on termination. The most common transition dispute is over tooling: the outgoing co-man claims ownership, demands buy-back at inflated value, or refuses to release physical possession. Documented ownership in the contract prevents all three.' },
      { q: 'What is a typical capacity commitment in a co-manufacturer contract?', a: 'For established relationships doing $1-5M annual volume, typical language allocates monthly units committed at approximately 80% of trailing 6-month run rate, with 60 days notice for material forecast changes. At scale ($5M+ annual), capacity commitment often rises to 90% of trailing 6-month run rate with a right of first refusal on additional capacity. For launch phases, capacity commitment is typically limited to first-run confirmed and second-run negotiated. "Commercially reasonable efforts" without a specific unit commitment is not a capacity clause — it is a courtesy that will be deprioritized when a larger customer\'s order arrives.' },
      { q: 'What insurance should a co-manufacturer carry?', a: 'Minimum product liability of $2-5M with the brand named as additional insured is standard; higher limits ($5-10M+) for higher-risk categories (supplements, cosmetics with regulated claims, ingestible food). General liability of $1-2M. Workers\' compensation per state requirements. Property insurance covering brand-owned tooling and materials at the co-man facility. Some brands additionally require product recall insurance ($1-5M) for regulated categories. Certificates of insurance should be attached to the contract and renewed annually with brand-notified verification.' },
      { q: 'What is a reasonable liability cap in a co-manufacturing contract?', a: 'Liability caps should be tied to your annual purchase volume — typically the trailing 12-month purchase amount or 2-3x annual purchase — not to a nominal fixed dollar amount. Fixed caps at $50K or $100K are inadequate for any meaningful volume, because they do not cover recall exposure. A single class-II recall routinely costs $500K-2M in destroyed inventory, retailer chargebacks, brand damage, and legal fees. Carve out from any liability cap: gross negligence, willful misconduct, IP infringement, breach of confidentiality, and indemnification obligations. Discuss adequate limits with your legal counsel based on your category and volume.' },
      { q: 'How long should a co-manufacturing agreement term be?', a: 'Standard commercial terms are 1-3 years with 60-90 day termination notice. Longer terms (3-5 years) should trade for specific, valuable commitments: lower per-unit pricing, protected capacity, tooling investment, or dedicated line. A long-term contract with no performance escape is asymmetric risk. Avoid auto-renewal without affirmative opt-out. If auto-renewal is in the contract, add a calendar reminder to your team for 120 days before renewal so you can either affirmatively renew or provide required termination notice.' },
      { q: 'What should be in a force majeure clause?', a: 'A useful force majeure clause enumerates specific events (natural disaster, government action, labor stoppage, pandemic-related restrictions), requires prompt written notice, requires mitigation efforts, suspends performance obligations but does not eliminate them, and gives either party the right to terminate if the event extends beyond a defined period (typically 60-120 days). Watch for one-sided language that excuses the co-manufacturer\'s performance while requiring your continued purchase obligations, or clauses that treat ingredient shortages as force majeure — which effectively shifts all raw-material price risk to you.' },
      { q: 'What are common red-flag clauses in a co-manufacturer contract?', a: 'The most common red-flag clauses: exclusive dealing without defined scope (prevents you from working with other co-mans on non-competing categories), automatic renewal without notice-based opt-out, price escalation formulas the co-man controls unilaterally, minimum purchase requirements without reciprocal performance obligations, consequential damages waivers without carve-outs for gross negligence and IP infringement, change control that requires co-man approval for your own formula changes, and unlimited co-man discretion on production location. Each of these shifts risk asymmetrically toward the co-man and should be renegotiated or struck.' },
      { q: 'What happens to inventory when a co-manufacturing contract ends?', a: 'Standard wind-down language provides that you purchase remaining raw materials at cost, work-in-process is completed and delivered, and finished goods are your inventory to receive. Payment terms on wind-down inventory should mirror ongoing commercial terms. Include a defined transition period (typically 60-90 days) during which the outgoing co-man continues production support, provides technical documentation to the successor, and cooperates on tooling relocation. Without documented wind-down provisions, transitions become negotiations at exactly the moment when leverage has shifted away from the departing party.' },

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is the typical retailer sequencing for national CPG expansion?', a: 'A common natural / specialty CPG sequence: regional independents (30-100 stores, Y1-2), regional chain (Sprouts, Fresh Market, regional Whole Foods) at 200-500 stores in Y2-3, Whole Foods or Sprouts national at 500-1,300 stores in Y3-4, Kroger regional divisions at 500-1,500 stores per division in Y4-5, then Target and/or Walmart at 1,900+ stores each in Y5+. Amazon FBA, DTC, foodservice, and international channels develop in parallel. Each step builds a specific operational capability the next step requires. Brands that skip rungs — e.g., regional independent directly to Target endcap — often fail in the first 6 months because they lack multi-DC distribution experience, chargeback discipline, and sell-through data to defend the item.' },
      { q: 'How much working capital do I need for national retail expansion?', a: 'Peak inventory investment for a national reset typically runs 4-8x current inventory level. For a specific example: adding a Kroger regional division of 750 stores across 4 DCs with 3 SKUs typically requires $400-500K in peak working capital (pipeline fill, distributor safety stock, DC safety stock, production run, slotting, free-fill, and initial trade spend). First-cycle receivables offset 40-50% within 90 days, so net cash outlay is typically $200-300K per major retailer expansion. Running two or three national expansions in parallel over 12-18 months can require $600K-1.5M+ in incremental working capital. Line of credit, factoring, or revenue-based financing usually becomes the operational constraint before production capacity does.' },
      { q: 'How much does OTIF non-compliance cost at Walmart?', a: 'Walmart currently charges 3% of shipment value for late delivery and 3% for short shipment, so a fully non-compliant shipment can pay 6% chargeback. A brand shipping $2M/year to Walmart at 85% OTIF pays approximately $60K/year in chargebacks; at 95% OTIF pays approximately $20K/year. The delta — $40K/year in preventable chargebacks — is the ROI on OTIF discipline. Prevention requires production and inventory planning that keeps safety stock at retailer-specific coverage, automated ASN generation, 3PL SLAs on on-window carrier pickup, and monthly OTIF scorecard review with root-cause coding for every failure.' },
      { q: 'When do I need multiple distribution centers?', a: 'The transition from single DC to dual DC (East + West coast) typically happens at $5-20M revenue when national account concentration makes cross-country freight the largest cost creep. Multi-DC (3-5 nodes) via a national 3PL usually makes sense at $20M+ when regional retailer DC networks (Kroger, Target, Walmart) each pull from a specific geography and cross-country freight compounds. The lane economics: shipping a 25-lb case from LA to Atlanta costs 3-4x the same case from Nashville to Atlanta. DC positioning becomes a margin decision at national scale, not just a service decision.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between conventional and natural distribution?', a: 'Conventional distribution (Kroger, Target, Walmart, Costco) operates on tighter margin, higher volume, harder compliance, and slotting fees that step-change with scale. Natural distribution (Whole Foods, Sprouts, natural distributor networks via KeHE/UNFI) operates on higher margin, lower per-store velocity, softer compliance, and category buyer relationships that reward category story. Most CPG brands scale through natural first because category buyers give emerging brands more room; then move into conventional as they develop the compliance discipline and trade spend budget conventional requires.' },
      { q: 'How does trade spend change when expanding nationally?', a: 'Trade spend as a percentage of gross revenue typically rises 3-5 percentage points during a national expansion phase. Regional retailers often accept promotional support at 8-12% of gross; national conventional accounts often require 15-22% to fund endcap programs, coop, MDF, national promotional calendars, and category resets. Budget for it before signing the retailer. Brands that treat trade spend as a variable expense end up cutting programs mid-year when it exceeds forecast, which damages retailer relationships and undermines the launch.' },
      { q: 'How do I know if my brand is ready for national retail?', a: 'The operational readiness signals: 12+ months of clean sell-through data from at least one distributor (KeHE, UNFI) or a regional retail chain, an EDI capability that handles the transaction volume without generating chargebacks, a co-manufacturer with capacity commitment for 3-5x current volume, a demand planning discipline that survives peer review, a broker network or sales team covering target retailer categories, and financing (line of credit, factoring, or equity) that can absorb the peak working capital cycle. Missing any two of these is a signal to fix the operational foundation before pursuing the next retailer.' },
      { q: 'What operational systems do I need for national retail scale?', a: 'At national scale, the systems that break spreadsheet capacity are: ERP integrated with 3PL and EDI (NetSuite, Cin7 Omni, Acumatica), a demand planning tool with SKU/channel forecasting (Cogsy, Streamline, Netstock), automated EDI (SPS Commerce, TrueCommerce), PIM for retailer data syndication, and warehouse management if you run in-house fulfillment. Most brands migrate to enterprise ERP between $15M and $30M revenue. The migration is easier at $15M than at $30M, so plan the transition before it becomes a crisis.' },

      { q: 'What is the difference between gross margin and contribution margin?', a: 'Gross margin is net revenue minus COGS (product plus inbound freight). Contribution margin is gross margin minus channel-variable costs: outbound freight and fulfillment, ad spend, promotional deductions, chargebacks, returns and damages. Contribution margin is the number that determines whether a channel is actually profitable to scale. A brand can have 80% gross margin on Amazon and land at 10-15% contribution after PPC, referral fees, and FBA costs. A brand with 47% gross margin on wholesale can land at 25% contribution when freight and deductions are managed. Investors and lenders increasingly look at contribution margin by channel, not blended gross.' },
      { q: 'What Amazon FBA fees should I budget for?', a: 'Referral fee 15% for most categories (8% for grocery under $15), FBA fulfillment fee $3.20-8.00 per unit based on size and weight tier, monthly storage $0.87-2.40 per cubic foot (2-3x in Q4), aged inventory surcharge $0.50-3.00 per unit at 181 days, removal/disposal $1.00-2.00 per unit, PPC ad spend 10-25% of sales for scaling brands (ACOS 30-40%, TACOS 15-25% for growth mode), and promotional program fees for Deals and Coupons. Total fee stack typically consumes 35-55% of gross revenue for scaling FBA brands. Model contribution margin, not gross margin, when evaluating whether the channel is worth scaling.' },
      { q: 'Is DTC or Amazon more profitable for CPG?', a: 'DTC typically produces higher contribution margin per unit when CAC is under control — often 40-55% contribution after acquisition, fulfillment, and returns. Amazon FBA typically produces 20-35% contribution after full fee stack and PPC. On absolute contribution dollars, the answer depends on volume: DTC is often more profitable per unit; Amazon often produces higher total volume at lower per-unit contribution. The best strategy for most CPG brands is not "choose one" but build a mix where each channel plays a strategic role — DTC for brand and margin, Amazon for velocity and discovery, wholesale for volume and shelf presence.' },
      { q: 'What is TACOS on Amazon and why does it matter?', a: 'TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales) is Amazon ad spend divided by total Amazon sales, including organic sales driven by ad activity. It differs from ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales), which only counts sales attributed to the ad. TACOS matters because it reflects the true cost of your Amazon presence — including the organic sales your ad activity supports. TACOS of 15-25% is common for scaling brands; TACOS above 30% signals ad dependency that will collapse if ad spend pauses; TACOS under 10% signals either strong organic momentum or under-investment in growth.' },
      { q: 'How is Vendor Central different from Seller Central on Amazon?', a: 'Vendor Central (Amazon 1P) sells product to Amazon at a wholesale price. Amazon owns pricing, promotion, listing, and consumer sales. Economics resemble distributor channels: lower per-unit margin (15-30%), Amazon controls pricing (can be a MAP-policy issue), and deductions (coop, MDF, chargebacks, post-audit) run 8-15% of gross. Seller Central (Amazon 3P FBA) keeps you as the seller of record with full control of pricing, listing content, and promotion — at the fee stack above. Most emerging CPG brands operate 3P FBA; some invitation-only or category-specific relationships operate 1P. Some brands run hybrid.' },
      { q: 'What packaging changes are required for each channel?', a: 'DTC requires e-commerce durable packaging designed for parcel shipping, with unboxing quality that supports brand and social sharing. Amazon FBA requires SIOC (Ships In Own Container) certification for eligible items, frustration-free packaging certification for premium items, damage-resistant construction, and prep compliance (poly bags, labels, expiration dates). Wholesale requires retail-ready packaging: case-pack configuration matching retailer specs, pallet configuration meeting retailer routing, GS1-verified barcodes, retailer-specific labeling and case labels, and packaging structural durability for pallet transit. A brand entering all three channels often needs three different packaging SKUs — or an integrated pack that meets all three sets of requirements at higher unit cost.' },
      { q: 'How does channel choice affect cash cycle?', a: 'DTC produces cash at checkout — the shortest cash cycle. Cash-out for ad spend often leads cash-in by 30-60 days depending on payback period. Amazon FBA settles bi-weekly (14 days after sale), with reserves held for returns and disputes. Wholesale operates on Net 30-90 receivables from retailers or distributors, and cash-out for production happens 60-180 days before cash-in — so the total cash cycle can extend to 120-250 days. Channel mix decisions have direct cash implications: shifting toward wholesale stretches the cash cycle and requires more working capital; shifting toward DTC compresses it but exposes to acquisition cost variability.' },
      { q: 'What is a good channel mix for a scaling CPG brand?', a: 'Mix depends on category, stage, and strategy. A common maturity mix for natural / specialty CPG: 15-25% DTC (highest contribution, brand control), 20-30% Amazon (velocity and discovery), 40-60% wholesale (volume and shelf presence). Beauty and personal care sometimes lean more DTC; grocery and beverage often lean more wholesale. The strategic question is not "what percent" but "what role does each channel play" — DTC often for margin and customer relationship, Amazon for scale and search visibility, wholesale for shelf presence and volume. Brands that build a mix where each channel plays a defined role tend to outperform brands that let mix happen by default.' },

      'Wholesale: 10–30% contribution depending on freight, deductions, and trade spend management.',

Add fill rate and forecast accuracy as wholesale volume grows above $1M. The point at this stage is establishing the discipline of measuring and acting on numbers — sophistication comes with scale. A weekly review of 4-6 metrics on a shared spreadsheet is more valuable than a 30-metric dashboard nobody looks at.' },

Independent retail typically accepts 90-95% fill; regional chains expect 95-98%; national retailers (Target, Walmart, Kroger) increasingly require 97-99%+. Below the retailer\'s expectation, chargebacks accrue and category buyer relationships strain. Above 99%, you are typically carrying excess safety stock that ties up working capital.

Formula: (Shipments on-time AND in-full) ÷ Total Shipments. Walmart currently charges 3% of shipment value for late and 3% for short (up to 6% for both). Target and Kroger have similar programs. Track OTIF weekly per retailer, with root-cause coding for each failure (3PL late, carrier late, short shipment due to inventory, ASN error). Prevention starts with production planning that maintains retailer-specific safety stock, automated ASN generation, and 3PL SLAs on on-window carrier pickup.' },
      { q: 'What is inventory turns and what is a good number?', a: 'Inventory turns = COGS ÷ Average Inventory Value. For scaling CPG brands, 4-8 turns annually is typical. Higher turns (10-15) indicate lean inventory management — great for cash but risks stockout. Lower turns (2-3) tie up working capital and expose to obsolescence, particularly for code-dated products. Turns should be tracked per SKU, not just blended: your top SKUs might turn 12 times while your tail SKUs turn 2. That mix is normal; blended is not diagnostic. Match turns targets to lead-time realities — long lead-time products naturally turn slower.' },
      { q: 'What is a good cash conversion cycle for CPG?', a: 'Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding − Days Payable Outstanding. For scaling CPG brands, 90-180 days is typical. Below 90 days is aggressive and often means very short lead times or very fast receivables. Above 180 days indicates cash pressure that will require financing (line of credit, factoring, revenue-based financing) to scale. The three levers: reduce inventory days (better forecasting, shorter lead times, smaller MOQs), reduce receivables days (faster invoicing, credit management, retailer terms), extend payables days (negotiated terms with suppliers). Covered in our <a href="/guides/cpg-working-capital-playbook">CPG Working Capital Playbook</a>.' },
      { q: 'How often should I review CPG KPIs?', a: 'Weekly for operational metrics (fill rate, OTIF, days of supply, stockout rate, damage rate). Monthly for financial metrics (gross margin, contribution margin, deductions %, cash conversion cycle) and demand metrics (forecast accuracy, channel mix). Quarterly for strategic reviews (KPI evolution as business grows, retailer scorecards, competitive velocity). The cadence should match the decision frequency — weekly metrics that never lead to weekly action are noise. Match cadence to when the metric can actually change your behavior.' },
      { q: 'What tools do I need to track CPG operations KPIs?', a: 'For brands under $5M: a well-structured Google Sheet or Airtable, refreshed manually from Shopify, Amazon Seller Central, QuickBooks, and the 3PL portal. Cost: near zero. For $5-15M: add a demand planning tool (Cogsy, Streamline, Netstock — $200-1,000/month) and a deduction management tool (PromoMash or manual disciplined tracking). For $15M+: ERP-integrated planning (NetSuite Advanced Inventory, Cin7 Omni, Acumatica — $2,000+/month) with automated data pipelines. Tool choice matters less than discipline: a $20M brand running well-executed spreadsheets often outperforms a $10M brand with an enterprise ERP nobody uses.' },
      { q: 'What is TACOS and how is it different from ACOS?', a: 'ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sales) is Amazon ad spend divided by sales attributed to the ad — the direct return metric on your ad spend. TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sales) is Amazon ad spend divided by total Amazon sales, including organic sales your ad activity supports. TACOS matters because it reflects the true cost of your Amazon presence including the organic sales lift ads produce. Scaling brands typically target TACOS in the 15-25% range; TACOS above 30% signals ad dependency (organic will collapse if ads pause); TACOS under 10% signals either strong organic momentum or under-investment in growth. Track both metrics; they tell different stories.' },
