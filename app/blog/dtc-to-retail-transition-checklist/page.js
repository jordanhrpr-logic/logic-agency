            <p>Key Takeaways</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Retail is an operations project with a sales component &mdash; not the other way around. The buyer says yes in a meeting; the work starts before it.</li>
              <li>The six categories with the highest chargeback exposure in year one: EDI compliance, routing guide adherence, case pack accuracy, packaging labeling, inventory depth, and margin math.</li>
              <li>Most first-year retail brands underestimate two things: the documentation burden during onboarding and the cash flow gap created by wholesale payment terms.</li>
              <li>A 3PL that is excellent at DTC parcel fulfillment is not automatically retail-ready. Ask specific questions before the PO arrives.</li>
              <li>The first 90 days in retail are a systems test. Track eight metrics from shipment one.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 id="category-1">Category 1: GS1, UPCs &amp; Product Data</h2>

          <p>Every retail SKU needs a valid, GS1-issued UPC. This is not optional for major retailers &mdash; their item setup systems trace the company prefix back to the issuing organization, and problems at this layer cascade into receiving issues, PO rejections, and phantom deductions.</p>

          <p>Most brands underestimate this category because they think a barcode is a barcode. It is not. A barcode is a data record, and that record needs to match everything the retailer has on file.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase a GS1 company prefix and assign it to your organization.</strong> A GS1-licensed prefix lets you create as many item codes as you need under your brand. Third-party UPC resellers are cheaper but create problems when retailers trace the prefix to a company that is not you.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a unique GTIN (UPC) for every sellable unit, variant, and SKU.</strong> Each distinct item &mdash; different size, different color, different bundle &mdash; needs its own GTIN. Using one UPC across variants is one of the most common first-PO errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Create separate GTINs for each packaging level: unit, inner pack, and master case.</strong> Retailers track inventory at every layer. If you do not register case-level codes, the receiving system cannot match the shipment to the PO.</li>
            <li><strong>Register item data in the retailer&apos;s item setup portal before the PO is issued.</strong> Item data includes product description, pack dimensions, gross weight, net weight, and GTIN. The retailer cannot build a PO against an item that does not exist in their system.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify that barcodes on final production packaging scan correctly at 100%.</strong> Test on the actual printed substrate &mdash; coated board, film, or label &mdash; because scanner contrast varies by material.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm all label copy matches the item data submitted to the retailer.</strong> If the weight on the retail label is 8 oz and the item setup says 8.5 oz, you will get compliance violations. Align these before production starts.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm country of origin is correctly declared on all label layers.</strong> Retailers require this. Some require it on the master carton, inner pack, and unit label separately.</li>
            <li><strong>Download and verify retailer-specific item setup requirements from their vendor portal.</strong> Walmart, Target, Costco, and Ulta each have different item setup templates, required data fields, and image specifications.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="category-2">Category 2: EDI &amp; Retailer Technology</h2>

          <p>EDI &mdash; electronic data interchange &mdash; is how the retailer sends purchase orders, how you confirm them, how you notify them a shipment is on the way, and how you invoice them. Most major retailers require it. The brands that treat EDI as a post-PO project discover the hard way that an untested EDI connection creates chargebacks before the product reaches the distribution center.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Identify which EDI transactions the retailer requires and confirm them in their vendor guide.</strong> The four core transactions are: 850 (purchase order), 855 (order acknowledgment), 856 (advance ship notice), and 810 (invoice). Some retailers add more &mdash; 940, 943, 944 for warehouse transfers; 997 for functional acknowledgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Select an EDI provider: cloud-based SaaS, 3PL-managed, or ERP-integrated.</strong> Cloud providers (SPS Commerce, TrueCommerce, DiCentral) run $150&ndash;$500/month and handle most major retailer requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete trading partner setup with the retailer&apos;s EDI team before your first live order.</strong> This takes 2&ndash;4 weeks if everything goes smoothly. Build it into your pre-PO timeline.</li>
            <li><strong>Test the 856 advance ship notice end-to-end before your first shipment.</strong> The 856 is the highest-chargeback EDI transaction. It must go out within the retailer&apos;s specified window &mdash; often 2&ndash;4 hours after pickup &mdash; and it must match the actual pallet contents exactly.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm invoice-to-PO matching before billing the first order.</strong> The 810 invoice must match the 850 PO exactly: item numbers, quantities, prices, ship-to addresses. Discrepancies generate deductions that take weeks to dispute and are often not recoverable.</li>
            <li><strong>Register for the retailer&apos;s vendor portal and verify your team has the correct access level.</strong> Most retailers manage POs, deductions, item setup, routing guide access, and compliance reporting through their portal.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your 3PL can either transmit EDI directly or supply the ASN data in the format your EDI provider needs.</strong> If your 3PL and your EDI provider are not integrated, someone is manually keying shipment data &mdash; which is where ASN errors come from.</li>
            <li><strong>Set up automated alerts for purchase order receipt.</strong> POs have ship windows. A PO that arrives Friday and requires a Monday ship date is not unusual. If the PO sits in an inbox over the weekend, you are already late.</li>
            <li><strong>Document the ASN transmission SLA for each retailer and build it into your 3PL&apos;s pick-and-pack SLA.</strong> If the retailer wants the ASN within 2 hours of pickup, the 3PL needs to transmit carrier and tracking data within 90 minutes of the truck leaving.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="category-3">Category 3: Packaging, Labeling &amp; Palletization</h2>

          <p>DTC packaging is designed for one job: get the product from a fulfillment center to a consumer&apos;s door intact. Retail packaging has four jobs: survive receiving, survive warehouse storage, stock efficiently on shelf, and communicate brand from a distance. These are different design briefs.</p>

          <p>Most packaging failures at retail are not structural &mdash; they are dimensional. Wrong case count. Wrong pallet config. Wrong label placement. Wrong barcode position. These are operational errors that the brand controls.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confirm case pack quantity matches the buyer&apos;s PO specification, in writing, before production starts.</strong> If the buyer ordered product in cases of 12 and you built cases of 6, every case on the shipment is wrong.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm master carton dimensions and weight with your 3PL&apos;s inbound receiving team before committing to production.</strong> Some warehouses have weight limits per carton (50 lbs is common).</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm pallet Ti/Hi (units per layer &times; layers per pallet) matches retailer requirement.</strong> Ti/Hi affects product per pallet, pallet height, and freight density. If your Ti/Hi is wrong, pallet height may exceed DC receiving limits (typically 72 inches from ground).</li>
            <li><strong>Verify GS1-128 carton label format with the retailer&apos;s vendor guide.</strong> The GS1-128 carton label contains shipment-specific data: PO number, destination DC, SSCC (serial shipping container code), item, quantity, and expiration date where relevant.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm inner pack structure and labeling if the retailer requires inner packs.</strong> Some retailers accept one layer of packaging (item &rarr; master case). Others require item &rarr; inner pack &rarr; master case.</li>
            <li><strong>Test shelf-facing visibility: run the product past the five-foot test.</strong> Put the product on a shelf at arm&apos;s length. Can you read the brand name and product type from five feet away without picking it up?</li>
            <li><strong>Verify barcode placement is visible on the shelf-facing side without rotating the product.</strong> Retail associates scan from the front. If the UPC is only on the bottom or back, it slows stocking and can create receiving variance.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm the product passes a compression test for stacked cartons.</strong> Products shipped on pallets are stacked. A folding carton that is structurally fine in a DTC mailer can crush at the bottom of a six-layer pallet.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm retail package copy complies with the retailer&apos;s category requirements.</strong> Some retailers restrict certain claims, require specific language on nutrition facts, or mandate net quantity in specific formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Photograph and document the final packout configuration.</strong> Take photos of the pack-out: unit in inner pack, inner pack in master case, master case labeled, pallet built. These become the reference document for every future shipment and the dispute evidence if a chargeback arrives.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="category-4">Category 4: 3PL Readiness &amp; Routing Guide Compliance</h2>

          <p>The 3PL decision is where DTC logistics infrastructure meets retail requirements &mdash; and they frequently do not match. An excellent DTC fulfillment partner built for parcel volume may have zero experience with retail routing guides, appointment scheduling, GS1-128 label generation, or palletized LTL shipments. Finding that out after the PO arrives is expensive.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ask your 3PL to list the retail accounts they have shipped to in the last 12 months, with chargeback rates.</strong> If they cannot name specific retailers and give you a compliance rate, they are not retail-experienced.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your 3PL can generate and print GS1-128 carton labels.</strong> This is a baseline capability for any retail-ready 3PL.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your 3PL can transmit or supply ASN data in the format your EDI system requires, within the retailer&apos;s required window.</strong> This is the single most common breakdown point between 3PLs that say they do retail and 3PLs that actually do retail.</li>
            <li><strong>Read the retailer&apos;s routing guide in full, not a summary.</strong> Routing guides are 20&ndash;60 page documents that cover carrier selection, appointment scheduling, label placement, pallet requirements, documentation, ship windows, and freight terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify your assigned carrier for each retail account and confirm your 3PL is approved with that carrier.</strong> Most major retailers control carrier selection. If you are tendering freight to a carrier the retailer does not accept, you are in violation before the truck leaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm appointment scheduling protocol and who owns it.</strong> Retailer DCs require appointment scheduling before a truck can deliver. The responsibility for booking the appointment &mdash; brand, 3PL, or carrier &mdash; varies by retailer.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm proof of delivery documentation requirements for each retail account.</strong> Most retailers require signed BOL and packing list at minimum. A shipment that cannot prove clean delivery has no standing in a chargeback dispute.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify retailer&apos;s collect vs. prepaid freight terms and confirm who pays the freight bill.</strong> Shipping the wrong way creates a chargeback even if the product is delivered correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a routing guide compliance checklist specific to each retail account and give it to your 3PL in writing.</strong> Do not assume the 3PL has read the retailer&apos;s routing guide.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your 3PL&apos;s process for flagging compliance variances before the truck leaves.</strong> You want the 3PL to catch label or pallet issues before pickup &mdash; not have the DC catch them at receiving.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="category-5">Category 5: Wholesale Margins &amp; Financial Readiness</h2>

          <p>The most dangerous thing a DTC brand does in its first retail year is accept a PO without modeling the actual economics. Retail is not DTC with a different price list. It is a different cost structure, a different cash flow cycle, and a different risk profile.</p>

          <p>A brand running 65% gross margin in DTC can land at 20&ndash;35% contribution margin in retail after wholesale pricing, freight, terms, deductions, chargebacks, and trade spend. That is not a failure state &mdash; it is the retail model. The problem is when brands do not model it in advance and discover the margin after the invoices arrive.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Build a retail margin model that includes every deduction category, not just COGs and wholesale price.</strong> Line items should include: COGs, wholesale price, inbound freight to DC, 3PL handling fee, retail compliance costs, chargeback reserve (2&ndash;5%), payment terms cash flow cost, promotional allowances, and co-op advertising if required.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm the buyer&apos;s payment terms and build a cash flow bridge for the gap between shipping and payment.</strong> Net-30 is standard. Net-60 and Net-90 exist. If you ship $200,000 in product on Net-60 terms and you are paying your supplier on Net-30, you need $200,000 in working capital for 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Model the price-to-volume tradeoff before accepting a large first PO.</strong> A first PO from a national retailer looks like a windfall. At 45% gross margin instead of 65%, the same revenue delivers significantly less contribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Reserve 2&ndash;5% of first-year wholesale revenue for chargebacks and deductions.</strong> This is a planning range based on typical first-year retail operations &mdash; not a target. Clean operations drive it toward zero. But a retail model that plans for zero chargebacks in year one is not realistic.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm insurance requirements: product liability limits and additional insured requirements.</strong> Most major retailers require $1&ndash;5M in product liability coverage and require being listed as additional insured on your policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Gather and organize vendor onboarding documentation in a single folder before the retailer asks for it.</strong> Standard requirements: certificate of insurance, W-9, ACH banking information, product liability certificate, certificate of analysis (if food or personal care), country of origin.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your accounting system can track deductions, chargebacks, and net revenue by retail account separately.</strong> If your first retail PO gets lumped into the same revenue bucket as your DTC channel, you cannot measure the account&apos;s actual profitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand the co-op advertising requirement before signing the vendor agreement.</strong> Some retailers include co-op ad requirements in the vendor agreement &mdash; typically 2&ndash;5% of purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your supplier payment terms versus expected retailer payment receipt.</strong> If you pay your manufacturer Net-30 and the retailer pays you Net-60, you are funding a 30-day float on every order.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify who owns chargeback dispute management and establish a process before the first shipment.</strong> Chargebacks require documentation and are time-sensitive &mdash; most retailers have a dispute window of 30&ndash;60 days.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="category-6">Category 6: Inventory Planning &amp; First-90-Day Operations</h2>

          <p>The most common failure mode in the first 90 days of retail is not a bad product or a bad buyer relationship. It is inventory. Specifically: too little inventory to replenish when the product sells, or too much inventory tied to a slow-moving variant that cannot be liquidated without damaging the account relationship.</p>

          <p>Both problems are planning problems. Both are solvable before the first shipment.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Build a 90-day inventory plan before shipping: pipeline fill, safety stock, reorder trigger, and production lead time.</strong> The pipeline fill calculation covers the quantity needed to stock the DC plus the quantity the retailer projects the stores will sell in the first 60 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm production lead times and place the reorder before the first shipment leaves.</strong> If your production lead time is 14 weeks and you expect to restock in week 8, the reorder needs to be placed before the first PO ships.</li>
            <li><strong>Map which SKUs the retailer has authorized and build a variant-level inventory model, not a brand-level one.</strong> A retail account that authorizes 3 SKUs will have different sell-through rates for each. The top SKU may need 3x the inventory of the slowest.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm the retailer&apos;s reorder cycle and build inventory depth to cover at least two order cycles.</strong> Retailers reorder on cycles &mdash; weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly depending on the account. If you are out of stock when a reorder cycle runs, the store goes empty and the account risks a buyer review.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify and confirm a secondary supplier or safety inventory for your fastest-moving SKU.</strong> Single-source risk for a retail hero SKU is high. A quality issue or production delay at your primary supplier during a retail launch can be brand-ending for the account.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish a weekly reporting cadence for the first 90 days: what metrics, who pulls them, who reviews them.</strong> The eight metrics that matter in year one: on-time ship rate, ASN accuracy rate, fill rate, chargebacks by reason code, retailer sell-through, inventory cover by SKU, reorder timing vs. reorder cycle, and gross margin after deductions.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm your 3PL can provide a retail-specific inventory report weekly.</strong> Most 3PLs have standard inventory reports. Not all have reports that separate retail inventory from DTC inventory, track lot numbers, or provide expiration date visibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Build an escalation path for compliance issues with a defined response SLA.</strong> If a carton label is flagged incorrect, who fixes it? If the ASN fails, who resubmits? These escalation paths need to exist on day one, not be improvised on day 30.</li>
            <li><strong>Read the first deduction notice within 24 hours and flag it to the right internal owner.</strong> Deduction notices have dispute windows. A notice that sits in an inbox for two weeks may be past the dispute window by the time someone looks at it.</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule a 30-day operations review after the first shipment and a 90-day business review with the buyer.</strong> The 30-day review is internal &mdash; did everything work? What failed? What needs to be fixed before the next PO?</li>

          <p>The DTC-to-retail transition is not complicated in theory. Every category on this checklist has a known solution and a defined process. The problem is that these categories cut across sales, finance, packaging, logistics, marketing, and operations &mdash; and in most DTC brands at $5&ndash;$20M, those functions report to the same person, have no dedicated owners, and run on shared systems that were not built for retail.</p>

          <p>The brands that navigate the transition cleanly are not the ones with the best products or the biggest buyer relationships. They are the ones that assigned a clear owner to each category, started the operational work 90 days before the first PO, and treated the buyer meeting as the milestone that triggered operations &mdash; not the milestone that completed it.</p>

          <p>The brands that get hit with $40,000 in first-year chargebacks, lose shelf space, and do not get reordered are usually not bad brands. They are operationally unprepared brands. The checklist above is the difference.</p>

          <h2 id="faq" className="b-faq-h">FAQ</h2>

          <h3>What should a DTC-to-retail transition checklist include?</h3>
          <p>A complete DTC-to-retail transition checklist covers six areas: GS1 and product data registration, EDI and retailer technology setup, packaging compliance and palletization, 3PL readiness and routing guide compliance, wholesale margin modeling and financial documentation, and inventory planning for the first 90 days. Most brands focusing only on the buyer relationship miss at least two or three of these categories entirely.</p>

          <h3>How long before a first PO should a brand start the retail readiness checklist?</h3>
          <p>Most brands need 60&ndash;120 days to prepare the operational systems for a first retail shipment, assuming the product, supplier base, and 3PL are already stable. EDI setup and testing typically takes 2&ndash;4 weeks. Packaging changes can take 4&ndash;8 weeks depending on production cycles. Starting the checklist after the PO arrives creates compressed timelines and expensive mistakes.</p>

          <h3>What are the most common first-year retail chargeback causes?</h3>
          <p>The most common first-year chargebacks are: late ASN or ASN errors, carton label non-compliance (wrong format, wrong placement, missing data), wrong case pack quantity, routing guide violations (wrong carrier, missed appointment window), and short shipments. Most of these are solvable with the pre-shipment checklist in Category 3 and Category 4.</p>

          <h3>Does every retailer require EDI?</h3>
          <p>Most major retailers &mdash; Target, Walmart, Costco, Kroger, Ulta, CVS &mdash; require EDI for all vendors. Some specialty retailers and independent boutiques use simpler portals or email-based PO systems. Confirm requirements with each retail account during vendor onboarding. Do not assume.</p>

          <h3>What is a realistic first-year retail chargeback reserve?</h3>
          <p>A planning range of 2&ndash;5% of first-year wholesale revenue is standard for brands in their first 12 months of retail operations. Clean, experienced operations drive this toward zero over time. A model that plans for zero chargebacks in year one is not realistic for a brand running retail for the first time.</p>

          <h3>How is the DTC margin model different from the retail margin model?</h3>
          <p>DTC brands typically operate with 60&ndash;70% gross margin before fulfillment and paid media. In retail, the brand sells at a wholesale price (usually 50&ndash;60% below retail), and absorbs inbound freight, 3PL handling, packaging compliance costs, payment terms, chargebacks, and promotional allowances. The result is typically 20&ndash;40% contribution margin &mdash; structurally lower, but scalable with volume if the account works.</p>
