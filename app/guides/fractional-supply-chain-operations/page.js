          <h2>What Fractional Supply Chain Operations Actually Is</h2>
          <p>Fractional supply chain operations means using an embedded operations team to manage sourcing, packaging, logistics, fulfillment, inventory, and retail execution&mdash;without hiring the full in-house team. For a scaling CPG brand, that usually means paying $30,000&ndash;$120,000 per year instead of building a $600,000&ndash;$830,000 operations department before the business is ready for it.</p>
          <p>This is not consulting. A consultant gives advice. A fractional operations team owns execution, manages vendors, fixes systems, and stays accountable month after month.</p>
          <div className="callout">
            <p><strong>The cost difference is real:</strong> $30K&ndash;$120K per year for a fractional retainer versus $600K&ndash;$830K for a senior in-house operations bench. The fractional model gives the brand the capability before the org chart catches up.</p>
          </div>
          <h2>Who Fractional Operations Is For</h2>
          <p>The strongest fit is a founder-led or lean executive team with real demand and increasing operational complexity. Usually a brand in beauty, wellness, consumer electronics, food, or CPG in the $5M&ndash;$20M revenue range.</p>
          <div className="cd-grid">
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">1</div><h3>SKU count growing faster than the team</h3><p>New products and variants demand supplier management, packaging development, and inventory planning no single founder can absorb alone.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">2</div><h3>Retail accounts asking for compliance</h3><p>EDI, routing guides, ASNs, pallet specs, and chargebacks all arrive with the first PO&mdash;and require systems most DTC brands were never built for.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">3</div><h3>Inventory is either out of stock or overstocked</h3><p>No clean middle. Reactive reordering, wrong safety stock calculations, and no 90-day plan.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">4</div><h3>Founder still managing suppliers directly</h3><p>Every vendor escalation, every missed date, every production issue lands on the founder because nobody else owns the system.</p></div>
          </div>
          <h2>What a Fractional Operations Team Actually Does</h2>
          <p>At Logic Agency, the operating categories fall into six areas. All six are concrete&mdash;not advisory strategy decks.</p>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">1</div><div><h4>Supply chain leadership</h4><p>Which suppliers to keep, replace, or qualify as backups. What the next 12 months of production actually requires. Where the brand is overpaying because nobody owns the system.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">2</div><div><h4>Global sourcing and vendor management</h4><p>RFQs, sample tracking, MOQ negotiations, lead time validation, production communication, scorecards, and backup supplier planning. Logic has manufacturing relationships across 15+ countries.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">3</div><div><h4>Packaging engineering and development</h4><p>Packaging structure, material choices, dimensions, unit economics, damage rates, and retailer requirements. A beautiful box that inflates dimensional weight by 30% is not a beautiful operating decision. See <a href="/guides/packaging-cost-reduction">Packaging Cost Reduction</a> for the hidden cost drivers brands consistently miss.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">4</div><div><h4>Logistics and fulfillment</h4><p>3PL selection, warehouse workflows, cartonization, freight planning, routing guide compliance, and fulfillment cost control across DTC, Amazon, wholesale, and retail replenishment channels.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">5</div><div><h4>Inventory planning and analytics</h4><p>Reorder points, demand planning, SKU-level visibility, sell-through tracking, and a realistic 90-day inventory plan that prevents stockouts and cash traps.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">6</div><div><h4>Retail readiness and compliance</h4><p>Routing guides, label specs, EDI, ASN timing, carton configuration, pallet requirements, chargebacks, and vendor portals. See <a href="/guides/first-90-days-in-retail">First 90 Days in Retail</a> for what changes once retail execution begins.</p></div></div>
          <h2>What Fractional Supply Chain Operations Costs</h2>
          <p>Fractional supply chain operations typically costs $30,000&ndash;$120,000 per year. Compare that to an in-house operating function:</p>
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>Typical Cost</th><th>Best Fit</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Advisory</td><td>$2.5K&ndash;$3K/mo</td><td>Early-stage planning, specific ops problem</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Active Management</td><td>$5K&ndash;$7K/mo</td><td>Recurring vendor, packaging, fulfillment work</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Embedded Operations</td><td>$10K+/mo</td><td>Retail launch, high SKU count, complex supplier base</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>In-House Role</th><th>Approximate Annual Cost</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>VP of Operations / COO-level leader</td><td>$220K&ndash;$350K all-in</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Supply chain or sourcing manager</td><td>$120K&ndash;$180K all-in</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Logistics / fulfillment manager</td><td>$90K&ndash;$140K all-in</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Packaging development / production manager</td><td>$110K&ndash;$160K all-in</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Tools, recruiting, onboarding, overhead</td><td>$60K&ndash;$100K+</td></tr>
              <tr><td><strong>Total function</strong></td><td><strong>$600K&ndash;$830K+</strong></td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h2>When to Go Fractional vs. Hire Full-Time</h2>
          <p>Fractional supply chain operations makes sense when the work is important, recurring, and cross-functional&mdash;but not yet stable enough for one full-time role.</p>
          <div className="save-grid">
            <div className="save-item"><div className="save-pct">Go Fractional</div><h4>Cross-functional, changing needs</h4><p>Sourcing, packaging, freight, inventory, and retail compliance all need attention&mdash;and none of them belong to a single job description yet.</p></div>
            <div className="save-item"><div className="save-pct">Hire Full-Time</div><h4>Stable, permanent, clearly defined</h4><p>The work is consistent, the role is large enough for one person, and the business can absorb the cost without starving growth.</p></div>
          </div>
          <p>Many brands use a hybrid path: fractional support to build the operating system first, then hire into a cleaner role later. The fractional team defines the role, documents the systems, stabilizes vendors, and makes the eventual hire more successful.</p>
