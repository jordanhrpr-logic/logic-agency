          <h1>3PL Selection Guide for Consumer <span className="o">Product Brands</span></h1>
          <p className="a-lede">Choosing a 3PL for a CPG brand comes down to six evaluation criteria: channel fit (DTC vs. retail), technology (WMS, real-time inventory, EDI), geography, retail compliance experience, pricing structure, and red-flag detection. Most brands optimize for the lowest pick-and-pack rate and discover too late that they picked a 3PL that can&apos;t handle their actual channel mix.</p>

          <h2>When You Need a 3PL and When You Don&apos;t</h2>
          <p>You do not need a 3PL the moment you launch. Early-stage brands can often self-fulfill while order volume is low. But self-fulfillment breaks when the business outgrows the operating model.</p>
          <div className="cd-grid">
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">1</div><h3>Leadership time going into daily fulfillment</h3><p>If the founder or core team is managing tracking numbers, packing exceptions, and carrier problems, the business is paying executive rates for warehouse work.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">2</div><h3>Inconsistent order volume strains internal labor</h3><p>Promotions, retail drops, and seasonal peaks create spikes that small teams struggle to staff without overpaying for headcount year-round.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">3</div><h3>Retail or wholesale entering the channel mix</h3><p>B2B fulfillment requires case packs, routing guides, pallet labels, ASNs, and compliance discipline that DTC fulfillment rarely demands.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">4</div><h3>Inventory accuracy slipping</h3><p>If the system says 600 units and the shelf has 420, the current process is no longer reliable. Inaccurate inventory creates stockouts, overselling, and returns that compound quickly.</p></div>
          </div>
          <h2>What to Look for in a 3PL</h2>
          <h3>Channel Fit</h3>
          <p>A DTC-only 3PL may be strong at Shopify orders and weak at retail shipments. A retail-focused 3PL may handle pallets and EDI well but struggle with branded unboxing or subscription kits. Hybrid brands need both&mdash;and should confirm both before signing.</p>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>Evaluate the warehouse management system (WMS). A modern WMS should sync inventory in real time, generate compliant shipping labels and pallet labels, file ASNs to retailer portals, track returns by reason code, and give you SKU-level reporting without requiring you to manually pull reports.</p>
          <h3>Geography</h3>
          <p>One warehouse works for most brands at launch. The math changes when your biggest retail accounts are on the opposite coast from your warehouse. A Midwest facility can often reach 90%+ of the US population in 2 days ground, which is frequently the most cost-effective single-node position.</p>
          <h3>Retail Compliance Experience</h3>
          <p>Ask specifically about compliance experience with your target retailers. &quot;We can do retail&quot; and &quot;We actively ship to Target, Whole Foods, and Walmart&quot; are different answers. Ask for the chargeback rate from recent retail clients.</p>
          <h3>Pricing Structure</h3>
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Cost Type</th><th>What to Watch For</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Receiving per pallet or carton</td><td>Can spike with large retail inbounds; understand cap or fixed-rate options</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Storage per pallet/month</td><td>Low base rate + minimum monthly fees can surprise brands with slow-moving inventory</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Pick and pack per order</td><td>Confirm DTC vs. B2B rates; retail orders (case picks) should cost less per unit than individual ecommerce picks</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Value-added services</td><td>Kitting, relabeling, FBA prep, and returns processing are usually billed separately</td></tr>
              <tr><td>Minimum monthly fees</td><td>Common. Understand the break-even volume before you pay minimums on a low-volume month</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h2>Red Flags in a 3PL Evaluation</h2>
          <div className="cd-grid">
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">!</div><h3>Vague retail capability claims</h3><p>&quot;We can handle retail&quot; without naming specific retailers, chargeback rates, or EDI trading partner experience is a warning sign.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">!</div><h3>No dedicated client rep</h3><p>If your primary contact during a problem is a general support queue, your operational issues will be deprioritized.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">!</div><h3>Inventory accuracy below 99.5%</h3><p>Ask for the current cycle count accuracy rate. Anything below 99.5% at a modern 3PL is a sign of WMS or process problems that will create ongoing headaches.</p></div>
            <div className="cd-card"><div className="cd-num">!</div><h3>No visibility into SLA performance</h3><p>You should be able to see order fill rates, ship time, damage rates, and return processing time in a dashboard. If they cannot show you these metrics for existing clients, you will not be able to hold them accountable.</p></div>
          </div>
          <h2>Switching 3PLs: What It Actually Costs</h2>
          <p>Switching 3PLs is not plug-and-play. Brands that underestimate the switching cost often find themselves managing two fulfillment operations simultaneously during the transition, which is expensive and operationally risky.</p>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">60&ndash;90 days</div><div><h4>Minimum transition timeline</h4><p>From signed contract to clean handoff, 60-90 days is the minimum for a reasonably smooth transition. That includes integration setup, inventory transfer, parallel operation, and compliance testing with retail trading partners.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">2x storage</div><div><h4>Dual inventory cost during transition</h4><p>You will carry inventory at both locations during the overlap period. Plan for 4&ndash;8 weeks of dual storage cost, especially if the transition spans a seasonal period.</p></div></div>
          <div className="audit-step"><div className="audit-n">1&ndash;3 months</div><div><h4>EDI and systems re-integration time</h4><p>Retail trading partner EDI connections must be re-established with the new warehouse. Each retailer connection requires testing. Errors during this window create chargebacks.</p></div></div>
          <div className="callout"><p><strong>The best time to evaluate your 3PL is before you need to switch.</strong> Annual reviews against current performance data are better than reactive searches during a crisis. Our <a href="/guides/retail-readiness">Retail Readiness Bible</a> includes the 3PL evaluation criteria that matter most for retail channel compliance.</p></div>
